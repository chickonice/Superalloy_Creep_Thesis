2.3	Outline of Research Project
		The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the creep rate and mechanical properties of an alumina-forming austenitic stainless steel, specifically the model alloy Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al, for different heat treatment conditions. 
		The investigation proceeded as follows:
1) A constant stress creep rig was designed and built.
2) Samples were prepared by machining and then heat treated at different conditions
3) Constant-stress creep tests were run for each sample.
4) Secondary electron imaging in a SEM was used to examine the microstructure of the samples prior to and after the completion of creep testing 
5) Strain rate jump tests were conducted on specimens under a variety of heat treatment conditions.
 	Chapter 3 covers materials preparation, the design, construction and testing of a constant-stress creep rig, and materials characterization techniques. Chapter 4 details the microstructure changes and precipitate evolution in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al before, during and after constant-stress creep testing. Chapter 5 discusses the effect of different heat treatment conditions on mechanical properties. 
		In Chapter 6, the conclusions of this research project are summarized. Chapter 7 suggests future work.

5.1	Strain Rate Jump Test Experimental   
   Strain rate jump tests were performed on the Instron 5690 tensile testing machine at 600 ºC and 700ºC on both as-received and TMT alloys. A preload force of 50 N was again applied on specimen before the strain rate jump tests were started. The initial strain rate for all strain rate jump tests was 5 × 10-5 s-1.

5.2	Results and Discussion

 Generally, the flow stress of alloys at elevated temperature is a function of the applied strain rate. The magnitude of the effect is expressed by the strain rate sensitivity m.  Theoretically, it is possible to carry out a series tensile tests at various temperatures and strain rates.  In practice, this is rarely done because of the limitations of time and the numbers of specimens required.  Instead, strain rate jump tests can be performed using a single specimen. The strain rate is increased to a second level (approximately an order of magnitude) once a steady state flow stress is obtained. 

            Strain rate jump experiments were performed on as-received and TMT DAFA29 at 600ºC. The strain rate jump test results are shown in Figure 4.5a.  The initial strain rate was 5 × 10-5 s-1 with an order of magnitude increase for each jump. The flow stresses of both TMT alloys increased with the strain rate increases.  But, the flow stress of as-received DAFA29 is relatively independent of strain rate at this temperature.  It is insensitive to the strain rate change at 600ºC. It is worth noting the serrations that occurred on the as-received DAFA29 during testing at 600ºC.  The serrated flow starts when the strain rate jumps from 5 × 10-5 s-1 to 5 × 10-4 s-1.  It is thought to be related to dynamic strain aging in this material. We will further explain these serrations in the discussion section.
            Strain rate jump tests were also performed at 700ºC which is the target application temperature for AFA stainless steels. The results of strain rate jump tests of as-received and TMT DAFA29 performed are shown in Figure 4.5b.  The initial strain rate was 5 × 10-5 s-1 with an order of magnitude increase for each jump. The flow stresses of all samples increased with the strain rate increasing.   At the strain rate of 5 × 10-5 s-1, the flow stress of as-received DAFA29 was 445 MPa which is almost twice that of TMT DAFA29 of 292 MPa.  When the strain rate is jumped to 5 × 10-2 s-1, the flow stress of as-received DAFA29 was 829 MPa, which is less than that of TMT DAFA29 of 1080 MPa.

Abstract
In order to achieve energy conversion efficiencies of &gt;50 % for steam turbines/boilers in power generation systems, materials required are strong, corrosion-resistant at high temperatures (&gt;700°C), and economically viable.  Austenitic steels strengthened with Laves phase and Ni3Al precipitates, and alloyed with aluminum to improve oxidation resistance, are potential candidate materials for these applications.  The creep resistance of these alloys is significantly improved through intermetallic strengthening (Laves-Fe2Nb + L12-Ni3Al precipitates) without harmful effects on oxidation resistance.   

This research starts with microstructural and microchemical analyses of these intermetallic strengthened alumina-forming austenitic steels in a scanning electron microscope.  The microchemistry of precipitates, as determined by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope, is also studied.  Different thermo-mechanical treatments were carried out to these stainless steels in an attempt to further improve their mechanical properties.  The microstructural and microchemical analyses were again performed after the thermo-mechanical processing. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction was used to measure the lattice parameters of these steels after different thermo-mechanical treatments. Tensile tests at both room and elevated temperatures were performed to study mechanical behaviors of this novel alloy system; the deformation mechanisms were studied by strain rate jump tests at elevated temperatures.  Failure analysis and post-mortem TEM analysis were performed to study the creep failure mechanisms of these alumina-forming austenitic steels after creep tests. Experiments were carried out to study the effects of boron and carbon additions in the aged alumina-forming austenitic steels.

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Background
            The energy efficiency of fossil-fired boiler/steam turbine power plants is strongly dependent on the operation temperature and pressure. An effective way to enhance the energy conversion efficiency of fossil fuel power plants is to increase their operating temperature and pressure. The operating temperature and pressure of current ultra-supercritical (USC) power plants are 600ºC/25MPa and this will eventually increase to 700ºC/35MPa and then later to 760ºC/35MPa for the next generation of advanced ultra-supercritical (A-USC) power plants [1-4]. Another benefit to running such power plants at higher temperatures and pressures is the reduction of CO2 emissions and carbon footprint. A key factor to achieve this is the materials of construction for boilers and steam turbines [5-7].  The materials used for the boiler/steam turbine in a A-USC power plant must be able to withstand not only this high operating temperature, but also have excellent oxidation and corrosion resistance, and most importantly be of low cost [8, 9].  Extensive efforts are underway to develop materials with high temperature strength, oxidation resistance/corrosion resistance, and low cost [10-12].  High-nickel alloy and nickel-based superalloy meet all the performance goals, but they are too expensive to use due to the high content of nickel [13-15].
             Heat-resistant FeNi-based austenitic stainless steels could potentially be used for USC power plants due to their good creep, good oxidation resistance and relatively low cost. However, they rely on the formation of chromia (Cr2O3) as the surface protection layer and chromia starts to lose its protective capability under aggressive environments at temperature above ~650ºC [16-18].  Ferritic FeCrAl alloys are available for long time applications due to their outstanding high temperature oxidation and corrosion resistance. But, they have poor creep resistance at temperature above 600ºC because of their open body-centered-cubic (b.c.c.) structure [18]. Face-centered-cubic (f.c.c.) austenitic stainless steels are the primary potential materials of construction for this high temperature application. They have a combination of high temperature (&gt;600ºC) creep strength, oxidation resistance and a lower cost because of a lower Ni content (~20 wt.% of Ni) [7, 19].  
1.2 Alumina Forming Austenitic Stainless Steels
            Recently, a family of inexpensive, high creep strength, alumina forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels has been developed [7, 20-29].  The materials have creep rupture lifetimes above 2000 hours at 750ºC and 100MPa, and good oxidation resistance at 650ºC (10 % water vapor) in air [7].  
           These alloys fall in a broad composition range of Fe-(12-15)Cr-(12-35)Ni-(2.5-4)Al -(0.6-3)Nb wt.% with addition of Al, Cr, Mn and Ni to maintain a single austenitic matrix phase [18]. They use MC carbides (M is mainly Nb) and M23C6 (M is mainly Cr, Nb) [24, 30] or L12-Ni3Al precipitates [31] as the main strengthening particles to enhance the creep performance.  Among them, the alloys based on Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-3Al-2Ti wt.% showed outstanding creep resistance at 650ºC and can be used as structural components in aggressive oxidation conditions [31]. The small amount of Al forms a protective alumina scale, which has superior thermodynamic stability over a chromia scale [12, 21, 32, 33].  Conventional heat-resistant stainless steels depend on chromia scale at elevated temperatures.  However, the chromia protection scale is compromised in the presence of water vapor, carbon, or sulfur oxidizing species [12, 32].  These aggressive species will accelerate oxidation kinetics and the material loss rate. An alumina protective scale grows at an order of magnitude lower rate than chromia scale in air [22].  Lots of effort has been spent on developing these alumina forming austenitic stainless steels.  However, in the past none of them has exhibited both high temperature creep strength and oxidation resistance.  This is due to the strong body-centered-cubic (b.c.c.) stabilizing effect of Al on Fe and the inability to maintain a single phase iron f.c.c. matrix, resulting in the  loss of the creep strength [8, 10, 30, 34, 35].  The significance of the recent development of alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels is the discovery that the alumina protective scale can be formed at 650ºC to 800ºC with 2.5 wt.% Al [7, 22, 25, 30], as shown in Figure 1.1


Figure 1.1 An alumina protective scale formed on the surface of alumina forming austenitic stainless steels (Fe-20Ni-14Cr-2.5Al wt.%) from reference [36].
            Multiple precipitates are observed in these alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels, mainly a Fe2Nb-type Laves phase, NiAl-type B2 phase, Ni3Al-type L12 phase, and MC carbide phase [30]. The amount of these secondary phases (Laves and B2 phase) depends mainly on the level of Al and Nb contents in the alloy system.  The addition of Nb is necessary to enhance the stability of alumina scale formed at a high temperature.  This results in forming the Fe2Nb Laves phase (C14) [7, 22, 25, 29].  The Fe2Nb Laves phase precipitates are thermally stable up to 1627ºC.  They are expected to be in equilibrium with NbC and the iron f.c.c. matrix [21, 24].  After aging treatment at 750ºC, NiAl type B2 phase precipitates (rod-like particles) with dark contrast can also be observed.   It has been reported that the B2 phase precipitates are not effective at improving the high temperature strength of austenitic stainless steels above 400ºC [11, 27].  However, they may enhance the creep resistance by affecting dislocation climb.  Creep testing at 750ºC results in a finer and denser distribution of these secondary precipitates than an aged alloy. These finer second phase precipitations are effective at increasing creep strength of alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels [30].  The B2-NiAl phase precipitates also play an important role in the oxidation resistance since they can work as an Al reservoir for forming an alumina scale at high temperatures [37].  
            Both Fe2Nb Laves phase and NiAl B2 phase precipitates demonstrate limited effects on the high temperature strength at or above 650ºC [29].  The development of the alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels is focused on introducing nanoscale precipitates like Ni3Al type L12 and MC carbide precipitates [29, 30].  Figure 1.2 shows a typical TEM bright-field image and selected area diffraction pattern of the Ni3Al type L12 precipitates in a Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-3Al-2Ti wt.% alloy.

            Coherent Ni3Al precipitates are effective for improving the high temperature mechanical properties in various nickel-and iron-based superalloys.  One example is the commercially-available iron-based superalloy A286.  A286 shows good creep properties due to the formation of coherent Ni3Ti type L12 phase at a temperature of ~730ºC.  But, the strengthening effect is limited because the L12 phase is metastable at higher temperatures [38, 39].  Coherent Ni3Al phase precipitates were reported previously in alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels [23].  These alloys were further optimized recently to maximize the stability of coherent L12 precipitates for better creep performance [29]. MC carbides (M: mainly Nb) are particles with a size of ~10 nm. They are effective at increasing the creep resistance by pinning dislocations in the iron f.c.c. matrix [21, 30].  
            Cold work is also effective for improving the creep properties of these alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels [30, 40-42].  The dislocations introduced during the cold rolling process act as nucleation sites for precipitates and results in doubled creep lives for these alloys at 750ºC [21, 24].  Trotter et al. [43] studied the effects of cold work on the microstructural evolution during aging of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at.%).  It was found that 90% cold work and aging at 800ºC not only caused a rapid precipitation of both Laves phase and B2-type NiAl precipitates, but also increased the total volume fraction of precipitates and hardness compared to the materials which had been simply aged.
             Recently, Tarigan et al. [44, 45] studied the grain boundary Laves phase strengthening mechanism in long term creep in an aluminum-free austenitic heat-resistant steel Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at.%). It was found that the creep resistance increases with increasing area fraction of grain boundary Laves phase precipitates. Dislocation pile-ups were also observed near grain boundary Laves phase, which was effective in suppressing the local deformation by preventing dislocation motion.
             Boron is also found to improve the creep strength in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at.%) by increasing the extent of the Laves phase at the grain boundaries [44, 45].  Simply aging the boron-free alloy to increase the extent of grain boundary coverage by the Laves phase from 52 % to 89 % increased the creep rupture life, and decreased the creep rate to a similar extent as the boron addition. 
             Yamamoto et al. [31] studied the additions of both carbon and boron on improving the creep and oxidation properties of Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-3-4Al-1-3Ti (wt.%).  It was found 0.1% wt.% carbon alone can’t improve the creep performance. The boron addition was associated with the improvement of creep properties. The creep test results are shown in Figure 1.3. It was hypothesized that the strain field between L12 phase and matrix caused the improvement of creep properties of this alloy. 
￼

            Chen et al. also studied Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at.%) with and without 0.03 at.% B and found that boron both increased the extent and produced finer Laves phase precipitates on the grain boundaries. The grain boundary coverage in the boron-doped alloy increased to 83 % upon aging at 800ºC for 24 h (compare to 75 % with boron-free alloy).  Using EPMA, they showed strong boron segregation to the grain boundaries.  They found that for both the boron-doped and boron-free alloy, longer aging times prior to creep testing increased the creep life and that for the same aging time boron doping increased the creep life by producing greater grain boundary coverage of the Laves phase. Their results were similar to those in previous studies by Tarigan et al. [46].  Essentially, boron appears to reduce the annealing time needed to obtain large grain boundary coverage by the Laves phase.
1.3 Outline of Research Project
            This thesis discusses the microstructure and mechanical properties of recently developed alumina forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels, specifically the Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-3Al-2Ti wt.% based AFA alloy after two kinds of thermo-mechanical treatments (TMTs).  The microstructure and room temperature mechanical properties of the TMT alloys will be discussed in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 will discuss the elevated temperature mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms. 
             In Chapter 5, the effect of boron and carbon addition to the aged AFA alloy will be outlined. The microstructure and elevated temperature mechanical properties were studied to explore influence of boron addition.
             Chapter 6 will discuss the characterizations of recently-developed AFA alloys after creep testing performed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).
             Chapter 7 is the summary and conclusions of this research project. Future work is also suggested

            Two TMTs of the DAFA29 were performed in an attempt to produce finer and uniformly distributed precipitates as shown in Figure 2.1 [47].  In the first approach (referred to as Method #1), the DAFA29 was cold rolled to a 90 % reduction in thickness with a ~4.5 % reduction per pass, and then annealed at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h.  In the second approach (referred to as Method #2), the alloy is given a solutionizing anneal at 1200ºC and then cold rolled to a 90 % reduction in thickness with a ~4.5 % reduction per pass before annealing at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h.

2.3 Materials Characterization
2.3.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy
        Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using an FEI XL-30 field emission gun (FEG) scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an electron backscatter detector (EBSD) and an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The EDS system utilizes a lithium-drifted silicon, thin-window detector that detects Z ≥ 4 with acquisition rates up to 10,000 counts per second. The operation voltage was 15 keV and the working distance was 10 mm for imaging and EDS.
2.3.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy
            A Tecnai F20 FEG transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 200 keV was extensively used to complete the microstructural characterization and dislocation configurations. Discs of 3 mm diameter were first produced by electro-discharge machining (EDM), and then ground to ~200 µm thick and twin jet electropolished in an electrolyte of 20% nitric acid, 10% butoxyethanol and 70% methanol using a Streurs Tenupol 5 at a voltage of ~10 V with a current of ~40 mA at ~260 K. After electropolishing, specimens were washed alternatively in ethanol and methanol for three cycles followed by a final rinse in fresh methanol. The resulting thin foils were examined using a conventional double-tilt holder with a capability of tilting 60° along two axes.  A CCD camera with 2048 × 2048 pixels was used to record images. Bright filed (BF), dark field (DF) images were taken under two-beam conditions with the deviation factor slightly greater than zero.
2.3.3 Mechanical Tests
            Tensile test specimens were milled to dog-bone geometry with a gauge length of 10 mm, width of 2.65 mm, thickness of 0.8 mm, and polished to a mirror finish using 800 grit silicon carbide papers followed by 0.3 μm alumina powder.
            After thermo-mechanical processing, room temperature tensile tests were performed with a Hydraulic MTS testing machine.  A preload force of 50 N was applied before the tensile tests were started.  The initial strain rate for all tensile tests was 5×10-4 s-1.  The elongations were measured directly from the specimens after the tensile tests.
            In order to compare the simple annealed samples (without cold rolling) to thermo-mechanical treated DAFA29, another two group of DAFA29 alloys were annealed as control samples. The first group (Method #1 control) samples were annealed at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h. The second group (Method #2 control) samples were annealed at 1200ºC and then post annealed at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h.  The room temperature tensile tests of these two groups of control samples were also performed under the same test conditions.
            Elevated temperature (600ºC, 700ºC and 800ºC) tensile tests were performed in air with an Instron 5690 tensile testing machine and a MTS hydraulic testing machine.  A preload force of 50 N was applied before the tensile tests.  The initial strain rate for all tensile tests was 5 × 10-4 s-1. Elongations were measured directly from the gauge of the specimens after the tensile tests. All the tensile tests were performed three times for each specimen. The resulting test data are shown as true stress- true strain curves.
            Strain rate jump tests were also performed on the same tensile test machine at 600ºC and 700ºC. A preload force of 50 N was again applied before the strain rate jump tests were started. The initial strain rate for all strain rate jump tests was 5 × 10-5 s-1. 
2.3.4 Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction 
           Thin foil specimens were polished from 200 μm thick disks to a thickness of 20 μm for synchrotron XRD measurements. The XRD experiments were performed at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory with the X-ray microdiffraction facility at undulator beamline 2-ID-D [30].  X-ray photons with energy of 18 keV (wavelength = 0.688 nm) were selected using a Si &lt;111&gt; double-crystal monochromator, and then focused to a circular spot of ~400 nm through a Fresnel zone plate. The diffraction signals were collected with a Rayonix Mar165 CCD detector, with 2048×2048 pixels and 80 micron pixel size, located ~58 mm downstream of the sample. The total counting time was 55 seconds. Over this counting period, the sample was continuously rotated around an axis perpendicular to the incident beam by 110 deg.













Chapter 3 Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of as-received and Thermo-mechanical Treated Alumina-forming Austenitic Stainless Steels


3.1 Introduction
            This Chapter investigated the effect of thermo-mechanical treatments on the microstructure and room temperature mechanical properties of recently-developed AFA stainless steels, specifically the Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-3Al-2Ti wt.% based AFA alloys.  During the treatments, the as-received AFA alloys was cold rolled to a 90 % thickness reduction (both with and without a solutionizing anneal at 1200ºC) and then heat treated at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h. Detailed microstructural analysis was performed on the samples before and after two thermo-mechanical treatments by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD). 
            In order to better understand the strengthening mechanisms at room temperature. Analytical simulation was carried out to study the effect of grain boundary strengthening and precipitate strengthening using Hall-Petch equations.
3.2 Experimental
            The details of fabrication and processing of AFA stainless steel, referred to as DAFA29, are described in Chapter 2.  The nominal and analyzed chemistry of the DAFA29 is given in Table 2.1.  
            Two thermo-mechanical treatments of the DAFA29 were performed and the details of the process are presented in experimental section in previous Chapter.  
            In order to compare the simple annealed samples (without cold rolling) to thermo-mechanical treated DAFA29, another two group of DAFA29 alloys were treated as control samples. The first group (Method #1 control) samples were annealed at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h without any cold rolling. The second group (Method #2 control) samples were solutionizing annealed at 1200ºC and then post annealed at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h without cold rolling.  The room temperature tensile tests of these two groups of control samples were also performed under the same test conditions. Figure 3.1 shows the flowchart of control samples compared to initial thermo-mechanical treatments.

3.3 Results and Discussion
3.3.1 As-received Microstructures
            A backscattered electron (BSE) image of as received DAFA29 showing the grain structure and the precipitates is shown in Figure 3.2a. EDS data acquired from the precipitates and the matrix are shown in Figures 3.2b and 3.2c, respectively.  The white precipitates are niobium enriched consistent with a Fe2Nb Laves phase.  The Laves phase precipitates are aligned along the rolling direction, as shown in Figure 3.2a (white arrow). They are observed both on the grain boundary as well in the interior of the grains.  The size of these Laves phase is in the range 0.5-10 μm.  Previous research suggested the strengthening effect of Laves phase strongly depends on its size and distribution [23].  Further refinement and stabilization of the Fe2Nb particle sizes to ~100 nm is needed to obtain better creep resistance [23]. MC carbides (M: Nb, Ti) are also observed in DAFA29. These precipitates are randomly distributed in the matrix with a size of ~5 μm.  They normally have a blocky morphology.  The predicted volume fraction of this phase is around 1% based on JMatPro simulation. 
￼

            A bright field (BF) TEM image of a precipitate in DAFA29 located on the edge of a thin foil is shown in Figure 3.3a.  A selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern taken from the f.c.c. matrix (lower circle in Figure 3.3a) is shown in Figure 3.3b.  The diffraction pattern consists of two sets of different diffraction spots, which are superimposed diffraction patterns from the L12 phase and the f.c.c. matrix. The weak diffraction spots are superlattice reflections from the L12 phase, whereas the strong diffraction spots are from both the fundamental reflections from an L12 phase and from the f.c.c. matrix.  The orientation relationship between the L12 phase and the f.c.c. matrix is cube-on-cube.  The superlattice reflection is similar to the diffraction spots observed in previous studies on similar alloys strengthened by nanoscale coherent L12-ordered intermetallic γ'-Ni3(Al, Ti) precipitates [48].  A convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) pattern from the large precipitate viewed along [0001] (after tilting) is shown Figure 3.3c.  It shows a hexagonal pattern.  Based on this result and previous EDS results (Figure 3.2b), it is confirmed that this precipitate is the Fe2Nb Laves phase.

3.3.2 Microstructures of Thermo-mechanically Processed DAFA29
            In order to produce fine and uniformly distributed Laves phase precipitates, two thermo-mechanical treatments were used to process DAFA29, as shown in Figure 3.1.  Previous research reported that cold rolling (with 10 % thickness reduction) of precipitate-strengthened austenitic stainless steels could improve creep properties, because the dislocations introduced by cold rolling acted as nucleation sites for fine MC (NbC) carbide precipitates, resulting in enhanced creep resistance [21, 42, 49].  It should be noted that the alloys examined here (DAFA29) can be cold rolled to more than 90 % thickness reduction, indicating that the coarse second phase precipitates do not degrade room temperature workability of the AFA alloys, similar to the results previously reported in [30]. 
            BSE images of DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1 are shown in Figure 3.4.  The steel was cold rolled to a 90 % reduction in thickness, after which it is evident that the large Laves phase precipitates had fractured (Figure 3.4b inset). These samples were then annealed at 800°C for 2.4 h (Figure 3.4c), 24 h (Figure 3.4d), or 240 h (Figure 3.4e).  The cold rolling fractured many of the Laves phase precipitates in the matrix resulting in smaller precipitates (Figure 3.4c, d and e).
￼

            BSE images of DAFA 29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #2 are shown in Figure 3.5.  The aim of using this method is to solutionize the large Laves phase precipitates before cold rolling. Unfortunately, the large Laves phase precipitates could not be completely solutionized at 1200 ºC, although the annealing significantly reduced their volume fraction from 4 % to 2 % (compare Figures 3.5a and 3.5b).  The solutionizing anneal also produced a substantial increase in the average grain size from 40 to 250 μm (all grain size was measured using the linear line intercept method).  As observed for thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1, the residual large Laves phase precipitates also fractured during the cold rolling.  Upon subsequent annealing, the size of the residual Laves phase precipitates did not change significantly.  After the 240 h anneal, fine-scale particles precipitated out and were evenly distributed in the matrix (Figure 3.5f).  These new precipitates presumably nucleated on the dislocations generated during the 90 % cold rolling.  The inset in Figure 3.5f clearly shows precipitates with two different types of brighter contrast, white and light gray, likely due to the presence of two different phase compositions.  The light gray phase is likely the Laves phase and the dark gray phase is likely B2 NiAl.  These small precipitates were also observed in previous research on AFA alloys [21, 24].
￼
Figure 3.5 BSE images of DAFA29: (a) as-received, (b) after a solutionizing anneal of 50 h at 1200ºC, (c) after a subsequent 90 % cold rolling reduction, and (c) after solutionizing, cold rolling, and annealing at 800ºC for (d) 2.4 h, (e) 24 h, or (f) 240 h.
            Table 3.1 shows the average size of the Laves phase precipitates after both thermo-mechanical treatments using the particle size image analysis technique used by Trotter et al. [50].  The sizes of the Laves phase precipitates are in the range 167-562 nm, i.e.: much smaller than the large Laves phase precipitates in Figures 3.2 and 3.3 which are 0.5-10 µm.  As the annealing times increases from 2.4 h to 240 h, the size of Laves phase increases from 167 nm to 417 nm for the samples treated by Method#1.  The size of Laves phase in materials treated with Method#2 is slightly larger than those treated by Method#1 for all annealing times.  This is due to the extra step of solutionizing in Method#2.

            Comparing Figures 3.4 and 3.5, the BSE images of the samples after solutionizing anneal show fewer Laves phase precipitates.  This is especially clear in Figure 3.5f, where the large Laves phase precipitates are barely observed.  Instead, the small precipitates are uniformly distributed in the matrix.  The solutionizing annealing used in Method #2 is an effective way to reduce the size and redistribute the Laves phase precipitates, resulting in a finer and denser distribution.  Most of the small Laves phase precipitates appeared to be coupled with B2 NiAl precipitates. Figure 3.6 shows a BSE image of the precipitates.  Based on EDS results, the brighter contrast precipitates are either Laves phase or MC carbides and the darker contrast precipitates are B2 NiAl precipitates. The B2 NiAl normally co-precipitates with the Laves phase during the thermo-mechanical treatment process. Such finer and denser distributed Laves phase and B2 NiAl precipitates (size are less than 1 μm) may be effective in further increasing the creep strength [30].

            BF TEM images and SAD patterns of DAFA 29 after cold rolling and annealing at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h (Method #1) are shown in Figure 3.7.  After the 2.4 h anneal many small grains with an average grain size of ~100 nm are present. The SAD pattern shows diffraction rings (Figure 3.7d), a feature characteristic of fine-scale f.c.c. grains having many different orientations.  As the annealing time is increased from 2.4 to 240 h, the grain size increased from ~100 nm to ~1μm.  The diffraction patterns changed accordingly as the number of grains captured within the SAD aperture decreased resulting in a single crystal diffraction pattern from a single grain.

            In conventional steels, elongated grains and/or aligned second-phase particles parallel to the rolling direction are developed after large strain cold rolling [51, 52].  For the AFA steels, no elongated grains are observed.  Instead, a large number of irregular nanoscale grains are observed in TEM of the 90 % cold rolled material after 2.4 h annealing, indicating that all the grains are fully recrystallized after the 2.4 h annealing process.
            BF TEM images and SAD patterns of DAFA29 after a solutionizing anneal at 1200ºC, cold rolling, and then annealing at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h (Method #2) are shown in Figure 3.8.  For the sample annealed for 2.4 h, many small grains are observed with an average grain size of ~200 nm with the SAD pattern exhibiting diffraction rings (Figure 8d).  This is similar to 2.4 h samples after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1, where fine grains (~200 nm) are produced by cold rolling and annealing for 2.4 h.  As the annealing time increases from 2.4 to 240 h, the grain size increases from ~200 nm to ~2 μm.
￼

            Comparing Figures 3.7 and 3.8, the average grain size produced by Method #2 is ~2 times larger than produced by Method #1, which is due to grain growth during the solutionizing anneal process.  This annealing step increases the average grain size of DAFA29 from 40 to 250 μm. 
            After thermo-mechanical treatment, the multiple second phase precipitates in treated DAFA29 were studied by TEM/EDS/CBED.
            A BF TEM image and EDS spectrum from a Laves phase precipitate in DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1 annealed for 240 h are shown in Figure 3.9.  The Laves phase precipitates appear darker than the matrix in the TEM image due to their greater thickness and/or compositional difference (heavy element Nb), and, hence, greater absorption. The inset in Figure 3.9a shows a CBED pattern from the circled region. The diffraction pattern indicates a hexagonal crystal structure aligned at [0001] direction.  EDS results from the same region of the Laves phase precipitate, Figure 3.9b, indicate that it is enriched in Nb and Fe.  The EDS data shows an atomic ratio of Fe to Nb of approximately 2:1, consistent with Fe2Nb precipitates, although the precipitates also contain some other elements.



￼

            The creep resistance of the alloys strengthened by Fe2Nb Laves phase particles alone was previously found to be relatively low at 750ºC and 100 MPa in air, which was attributed to the relatively coarse size of the Fe2Nb precipitates [21].  Both large size and small size Fe2Nb precipitates can be observed in DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1, as shown in Figure 3.9.  These newly formed small Laves phase precipitates (~1 μm) might be helpful to enhance the creep performance. 
            A BF TEM image and EDS results from a NiAl precipitate in DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1 and annealed for 240 h are shown in Figure 3.10. The CBED pattern in Figure 3.10b inset corresponds to a B2 structure viewed along the [211] zone axis.  EDS analysis results from the circled region of the NiAl precipitate are shown in Figure 3.10b.  Although the precipitates are mostly Ni and Al, they also contain other elements.  The NiAl precipitates are observed after both thermo-mechanical treatments. They are not present in the as-received DAFA29.  A previous study suggested this B2 phase is likely to increase the creep resistance by affecting dislocation climb in the f.c.c. matrix due to their resistance to dislocation cutting during creep deformation [24, 30].

            The B2 phase precipitates also play an important role for the oxidation resistance of the alloy and work as Al reservoirs, which provide Al to maintain the protective alumina scale on the material’s surface at high temperature [30].
            A BF TEM image and EDS results from a Ni3Al precipitate on the edge of a thin foil from DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1 and annealed 240 h are shown in Figure 3.11.  The Ni3Al precipitates are spherical with a diameter less than 100 nm.  The inset in Figure 3.11a shows a CBED pattern from the circled region of theNi3Al precipitate.  This corresponds to a pattern from an L12 structure viewed along the [212] zone axis.  EDS data acquired from the region circled in TEM image of this precipitate is shown in Figure 3.11b.  The atomic ratio of Ni to Al(Ti) is approximately 3:1, with small amounts of other elements present. 
￼
Figure 3.11 (a) BF TEM image, (b) EDS spectrum, and CBED pattern from a Ni3Al precipitate in DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1, annealed 240 h.
            The average size of the L12 precipitates in this heat-treated alloy is ~84 nm, which is about eight times larger than in the as-received alloy.  These L12 precipitates have a similar size to the Ni3Al observed in the AFA alloy after creep tests of 3008 h at 750ºC and 100 MPa [48].  Besides the spherical L12 precipitates, no other nanoscale particles, such as carbides or borides, are observed after the thermo-mechanical treatments.
            MC carbide (M: Nb, Ti) precipitates are also observed in DAFA29 both before and after thermo-mechanical treatments.  Figure 3.12 shows a secondary electron image of MC carbides in one thermo-mechanical treated DAFA29 sample. The upper inset in Figure 3.12b is an EBSD pattern, indicating that this is the [011] zone axis of a f.c.c. precipitate. Both the pattern and EDS results show this is an MC precipitate.
￼

            Since the lattice parameters of the f.c.c. matrix and L12 precipitates are similar, synchrotron XRD was used to determine their respective lattice parameters in the alloy. Synchrotron XRD results from the DAFA29 samples after a 1200ºC solutionizing anneal for 50 h, 90 % cold rolling, and then an 800ºC anneal for 240 h, are shown in Figure 3.13.  The 240 h annealed samples were selected for this measurement because the size of precipitates is larger due to particle coarsening, and hence, the XRD signal will be stronger than in the 24 or 2.4 h annealed samples.  In the XRD pattern, the Miller indices of the f.c.c. peaks are labeled in blue, the L12 superlattice peaks are labeled in red, the Laves phase peaks are labeled in black, and B2 peaks are labeled in green.
￼

            The lattice parameters for each phase were calculated based on the highest angle peaks of each phase. The calculated lattice parameters for the phases in the 240 h annealed sample were: the L12 phase is equal to 3.609 Å, the f.c.c. matrix is equal to 3.599 Å, and the NiAl phase is equal to 2.892 Å. The lattice misfit between the L12 precipitates and the f.c.c. matrix was only 0.28 % after the 240 h heat treatment, indicating that very small elastic strain (~0.28 %) between the precipitates and the f.c.c. matrix is developed.
3.3.3 Mechanical Properties of Thermo-mechanical Processed DAFA
            The room temperature tensile test results for DAFA29 after the two different thermo-mechanical treatments are shown in Figure 3.14. The samples in Figure 3.14a were cold rolled and then annealed at 800ºC for different times.  The yield strength and plastic strain to failure of as-received DAFA29 are 560 MPa and 22 %, respectively.  The yield strength increased to 1280 MPa and the plastic strain decreased to 5.1 % after cold rolling and a 2.4 h anneal.  The yield strength decreased with further annealing; the yield strength of the sample after a 24 h anneal was 1070 MPa, and was reduced to 800 MPa when the sample was annealed for 240 h. Surprisingly, the strain to failure for all the cold rolled and annealed samples did not change significantly as the annealing time increased and the yield strength decreased.
￼
Figure 3.14 Tensile test results for DAFA29 after the two different thermo-mechanical treatments.  (a) Samples are treated under Method #1 compared to as-hot-rolled DAFA29, (b) Samples are treated under Method #2 compared to as-hot-rolled DAFA29, (c) Samples are treated under Method #1 without cold rolling, and (d) two step annealed samples without cold rolling compared to as-hot-rolled DAFA29
            The samples shown in Figure 3.14b were treated with the additional step of a solutionizing anneal before cold rolling.  Again, the yield strength increased to 1150 MPa and the plastic strain decreases to 6.2 % after this treatment followed by a 2.4 h anneal. The yield strength decreased to 1020 MPa for an increase in the annealing time to 24 h, and was further reduced to 750 MPa after an anneal for 240 h. Again, the strain to failure for the samples treated by this method did not change significantly after cold rolling and different annealing times.
            The room temperature yield strengths of these treated DAFA29 specimens are four times higher than previous solution heat treated AFA alloys and two times higher than the aged AFA alloys studied in [30].  This difference is mainly due to the nm-scale or µm-scale grains generated after either thermo-mechanical treatment.  Comparison between Figures 3.14a and 3.14b reveals that the solutionizing anneal is not effective in enhancing the tensile strength of DAFA29, although it is helpful to reduce the size of Laves phase and produce a finer and denser distribution of the Laves phase precipitates.
            The tensile test results of the DAFA29 control samples after thermal treatment (Method #1 without cold work) are shown in Figure 3.14c.  Simply, the control samples are annealed at 800ºC for different periods without any cold work.  The yield strength increased to 747 MPa from 560 MPa and the plastic strain decreased slightly to 20 % after a 2.4 h anneal.  The yield strength further increased to 890 MPa and the plastic strain decreased to 10 % after a 24 h anneal.  For a 240 h annealing time, the yield strength decreased to 760 MPa, while the plastic strain still continued to decrease to 8 %.
            For comparison, the tensile test results for DAFA29 control samples after using the thermal treatment (Method #2 without cold work) are shown in Figure 3.14d.  Basically, the control samples are solutionized anneal at 1200ºC followed by anneal at 800ºC for different periods without any cold work.  The results show that all the samples after this two-step annealing are brittle and exhibit no plastic strain.  The yield strength is slightly higher than that of the as-hot-rolled DAFA29 of 560 MPa.
            In order to better understand the correlation between the grain size and the room temperature mechanical properties obtained, the Hall-Petch relation for all treated DAFA29 alloys was determined as shown in Figure 3.15.  The yield strength of the thermo-mechanically treated steel obeys a Hall-Petch relationship between the yield strength σ0.2 and the grain size D, i.e.: σ0.2= σ0 + KD-0.5, where σ0 = 558 MPa and K = 254 MPa•μm-0.5 for the Method#1 alloys and σ0 = 535 MPa and K = 284 MPa•μm-0.5 for the Method#2 alloys, according to the linear fit to the yield strength versus D-0.5.  The value of σ0 differs considerably from that obtained in a 63 % cold rolled AISI 301 austenitic stainless steel [53] of 252 MPa (the values of K was 270 MPa•μm-0.5, similar to this work). The Method#1 alloys show a slightly higher off-set stress σ0 than Method#2 alloys which might be due to the different precipitate size in these two alloys. 
￼
Figure 3.15 A plot of Hall-Petch relationship for DAFA29 after the two different thermo-mechanical treatments
            The stress σ0 can be described, in general, as the sum of several strengthening mechanisms: 1) precipitate strengthening (σppt), 2) strain hardening (σd), and 3) solid solution strengthening (σss) [53].  The off-set stress can be expressed as 
σ0 = σppt+ σd+σss                                                                           (3.1)
            The large σ0 observed in the current work likely arises from substantial precipitate strengthening from the finely spaced L12-Ni3Al precipitates.  The estimated σppt is ~289 MPa according to the Equation 3.2 and 3.3 (based on the Orowan looping mechanism) in [9].
￼                                     (3.2)
            where G is the shear modulus (MPa), b is the burgers vector (nm), d is the particle diameter (nm), and L is the particle spacing (nm).  For this calculation, a shear modulus of 80,000 MPa and a burgers vector of 0.25 nm were used.  The particle diameter used for the calculation is 84 nm. The equation 3.2 can be converted to the following equation: 
￼                                          (3.3)
            where f is the precipitate volume fraction and 10.8 is in the unit of MPa·nm. The volume percent of L12 Ni3Al precipitates is 21 % [48].  According this calculation, the precipitate strengthening σppt contributes almost half of the value of the off-set stress σ0.  Note the value of σppt is variable and depends on the precipitates size and dislocation-precipitate interaction mechanism.
            BSE images of the cross-sections of the strained microstructure for DAFA29 after treatment with Method#1, Method#2, Method#1 without cold rolling, and Method#2 without cold rolling are shown in Figures 3.16a-d, respectively.  Figure 3.16e-h are the corresponding BSE images of the fracture surface of those four samples. In the sample treated with Method#1 the large Laves phase fractured perpendicular to the applied stress direction (Figure 3.16a).  The fracture surface shows small dimples with Laves and/or B2 phase in the dimple center (Figure 3.16e). Large Laves phase and MC carbide are also observed on fracture surface in this sample. In the sample treated with Method#2 (Figure 3.16b and f), the fracture surface shows small dimples similar to Figure 3.16e with size of 1 to 2 µm.  In the sample treated with Method#1 without cold rolling (Figure 16c and g), grain boundary precipitates are generated after annealing for 240 h.  Larger cracks are observed along the grain boundaries. The fracture surface indicates the failures are both on grain boundaries and in the matrix. Both fine grain boundary precipitates and large dimples are observed. For the sample treated with Method#2 without cold rolling (Figure 3.16d and h), Laves phase precipitates (exhibiting bright contrast) are present on the grain boundaries and triple junctions (Figure 3.16d). In some triple junctions, the eutectic structure of the Laves phase is observed. These eutectic structures indicate melting of the Laves phase during the 1200ºC solutionizing treatment. The fracture surface of the materials after the 240 h anneal, shown in Figure 3.16h, show intergranular fracture.  This fracture mode of the material is different from the others since the grain boundaries were fully covered by Laves phase and NiAl precipitates. The elongation of this sample is less than 1 % as shown in Figure 3.14d.

3.4 Summary
            Microstructural analyses and mechanical testing of the recently developed AFA stainless steel alloy DAFA29 has been performed in both the as-received condition and after two series of thermo-mechanical treatments.  During these treatments, materials were cold rolled to a 90 % thickness reduction (both with and without a solutionizing anneal at 1200ºC) and then heat treated at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h.
            It was found that:
1.	A solutionizing anneal at 1200ºC followed by cold rolling and annealing at 800ºC can be used to generate a finer-scale and more uniform distribution of Laves phase precipitates.
2.	The solution anneal produces a large increase in grain size from 40 to 250 μm.
3.	The alloy contain Fe2Nb Laves phase, MC carbide, Ni3Al(Ti) L12, and B2 NiAl precipitates after either thermo-mechanical treatment. 
4.	Cold rolling produces a high density of dislocations, which act as nucleation sites for Fe2Nb Laves phase, MC carbide, B2 NiAl, and Ni3Al(Ti)  precipitate formation.
5.	Nanocrystalline grains are produced after cold rolling and short time anneals, which grow rapidly to µm-scale size on subsequent annealing at 800ºC.
6.	Nanocrystalline steels processed through large strain cold rolling exhibit a dramatic increase in yield strength up to 1280 MPa.  The yield strength decreases upon further annealing due to grain growth and precipitate coarsening.
7.	The yield strength of thermo-mechanically treated AFA steels exhibits a Hall-Petch relationship with a large value for σ0 that likely arises from precipitate strengthening (σppt).






Chapter 4 The Effect of Thermo-mechanical Treatment on the High Temperature Tensile Behavior of an Alumina-forming Austenitic Steel


4.1	Introduction
             In previous chapter, two TMTs were performed on this AFA stainless steel, specifically DAFA29, in an attempt to further improve the mechanical properties. The microstructures and deformation behavior of this AFA alloy in both the as-received condition and after the TMTs were characterized at room temperature. The TMT reduced the grain size significantly to the nanoscale (~100 nm) and increased the room temperature yield strength to above 1000 MPa.
            In this chapter, the deformation behavior of this AFA alloy in both the as-received condition and after the TMTs was studied at elevated temperatures from 600ºC to 800ºC.  The flow stress of the TMT materials was evaluated at different strain rates, and the high temperature deformation mechanisms were studied.
4.2	Experimental 
4.2.1	Tensile Tests at Elevated Temperature 
            Tensile test specimens were milled to dog-bone geometry with a gauge length of 10 mm, width of 2.65 mm, thickness of 0.8 mm, and polished to a mirror finish using 800 grit silicon carbide papers followed by 0.3 μm alumina powder.
            Elevated temperature (600 ºC, 700ºC and 800ºC) tensile tests were performed with an Instron 5690 tensile testing machine and a MTS hydraulic testing machine.  A preload force of 50 N was applied before the tensile tests.  The initial strain rate for all tensile tests was 5 × 10-4 s-1. Elongations were measured directly from the gauge of the specimens after the tensile tests. All the tensile tests were performed three times for each specimen. The resulting test data are shown as true stress- true strain curves.
            The as-received DAFA29 were tensile tested at different strain rate from 5 × 10-6 to 5 × 10-2 s-1 on the Instron 5690 tensile testing machine at 700ºC.
4.2.2	Strain Rate Jump Tests at Elevated Temperature 
            Strain rate jump tests were performed on the Instron 5690 tensile testing machine at 600 ºC and 700ºC on both as-received and TMT alloys. A preload force of 50 N was again applied on specimen before the strain rate jump tests were started. The initial strain rate for all strain rate jump tests was 5 × 10-5 s-1.
4.3	Results 
4.3.1 Tensile Tests at Elevated Temperatures
            Tensile tests of TMT Method#1 alloys were performed at 700ºC. The stress strain curves of the three TMT alloys are shown in Figure 4.1a.  All three TMT alloys show lower yield strength but higher elongation compared to the as-received DAFA29, see Table 4.1.  The tensile behaviors of these TMT alloys at 700ºC are significantly different from room temperature.  They show yield strength above 1000 MPa in room temperature tensile tests [47]. 
            Tensile tests of TMT alloys Method#2 were also carried out at 700ºC. The stress strain curves of the three TMT alloys are shown in Figure 4.1b. The results are similar to the stress strain curves observed for the TMT Method#1 tests.  All the TMT alloys show lower yield strength, but higher elongation.  The yield strengths (measured as 0.2% proof stress) were in the range of 270-346 MPa, see Table 4.1.

            After the tensile tests at 700ºC, all test specimens were characterized using the SEM. All the treated samples have different shapes of the necked region because of differences in ductility.  TMT (Method#1) alloys after ageing for 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h showed reductions in area of 33 %, 64 %, and 93 %, respectively. The differences in the reduction in area are due to the different grain sizes for these three treated samples [47]. The grain sizes of TMT (Method#1) annealed for 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h samples are ~100 nm, ~270 nm, and ~1 µm, respectively [47].  Thus, the elongation and reduction in area increased with increasing grain size, presumably due to the reduction in yield strength. 
            For TMT alloys treated using Method#2, the reductions in area for the 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h samples were 49 %, 67 % and 91 %, respectively.  The microstructures of these TMT alloys were shown in our previous work in [47]. The grain size of TMT samples with ageing 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h are ~200 nm, ~450 nm, and ~2 µm, respectively.  The 240 h annealed TMT alloy also has the largest area reduction and the highest elongation up to 53 % due to the fast grain growth to larger than 2 µm during 800ºC annealing [47].
            Figure 4.2 shows fracture surfaces of as-received DAFA29, TMT 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h samples after tensile testing at 700ºC.  The fracture surface of as-received DAFA29 shows ductile failure with large ductile dimples and considerable plastic deformation between the dimples. The fracture surfaces of TMT alloys are covered with a thick layer of oxide due to exposure at high temperature during the tensile tests. However, the Laves phase precipitates, which show white contrast, are still visible.  There are no dimples evident on the fracture surface for all three TMT alloys, although the materials are all much more ductile than as-received DAFA29.  This ductility is due to the small grain sizes (ranging from ~100 nm to 1 µm) of these three TMT samples.   All three fracture surfaces are coved by a layer of oxide formed during tensile test at 700ºC

            As-received and TMT DAFA29 samples were also tested at elevated temperatures from 600ºC to 800ºC. The resulting true stress-strain curves are shown in Figure 4.3.  At 600ºC (Figure 4.3a), the stress strain curve of as-received DAFA29 has a yield stress of 535 MPa, shows considerable work-hardening and an ultimate tensile strength of 665 MPa at an elongation of 20 %.  The TMT alloys showed higher yield strengths of 928 and 886 MPa for Method#1 and Method#2, respectively.  At 800ºC, the yield strength of as-received DAFA29 decreased to 360 MPa with no work-hardening evident.  The yield strength of TMT alloys decreased dramatically lower to 150 (Method#1) and 120 MPa (Method#2) with elongations more than 40 %.

            Figure 4.4 provides a summary of the yield stress of as-received and TMT DAFA29 tested at different temperatures. The behavior of  as-received DAFA29 is similar to many f.c.c. alloys reported in the literature [3, 54], i.e.: nickel-base superalloys and nickel iron-base superalloy. The yield strength is not greatly affected by the increase in temperature until it reaches a certain temperature.  This transition temperature is 600ºC for the as-received DAFA29. The flow stress of L12 precipitates increase anomalously with increase of temperature [55]. Therefore, the temperature independence of the yield strength of AFA alloys until 600ºC is the net effect of strength reduction of f.c.c. phase compensated by the increase of strength from L12 precipitates [55].  
            The TMT AFA alloys show yield stresses significantly larger than the as-received DAFA29 at room temperature.  This is due to the fine grain size present after the TMT process for both TMT methods (100-200 nm). Details of the room temperature tensile test results were described in previous published paper [47]. As the temperature increased to 600ºC, the yield stress of the TMT alloys decreased gradually until 600ºC and then decreased dramatically at 700ºC.   This significant loss of stress in the range of 600ºC to 700ºC might be due to increased diffusion rates in TMT alloys leading to fast dislocation climb.  The large volume of grain boundaries in TMT alloys lose the function to interrupt of dislocation motion due to the fast dislocation climbing. The grain boundaries work as sites of weakness above 600ºC.
            At 800ºC, this grain boundary effect is more obvious. The yield strength of TMT alloys is less than half of the yield strength of as-received DAFA29 as shown in Figure 4.4.  At this temperature, dislocations will be able to move around obstacles easily, the grain refined TMT alloys become significantly weaker.

4.3.2 Strain Rate Jump Tests at Elevated Temperatures
            Generally, the flow stress of alloys at elevated temperature is a function of the applied strain rate. The magnitude of the effect is expressed by the strain rate sensitivity m.  Theoretically, it is possible to carry out a series tensile tests at various temperatures and strain rates.  In practice, this is rarely done because of the limitations of time and the numbers of specimens required.  Instead, strain rate jump tests can be performed using a single specimen. The strain rate is increased to a second level (approximately an order of magnitude) once a steady state flow stress is obtained. 
            Strain rate jump experiments were performed on as-received and TMT DAFA29 at 600ºC. The strain rate jump test results are shown in Figure 4.5a.  The initial strain rate was 5 × 10-5 s-1 with an order of magnitude increase for each jump. The flow stresses of both TMT alloys increased with the strain rate increases.  But, the flow stress of as-received DAFA29 is relatively independent of strain rate at this temperature.  It is insensitive to the strain rate change at 600ºC. It is worth noting the serrations that occurred on the as-received DAFA29 during testing at 600ºC.  The serrated flow starts when the strain rate jumps from 5 × 10-5 s-1 to 5 × 10-4 s-1.  It is thought to be related to dynamic strain aging in this material. We will further explain these serrations in the discussion section.
            Strain rate jump tests were also performed at 700ºC which is the target application temperature for AFA stainless steels. The results of strain rate jump tests of as-received and TMT DAFA29 performed are shown in Figure 4.5b.  The initial strain rate was 5 × 10-5 s-1 with an order of magnitude increase for each jump. The flow stresses of all samples increased with the strain rate increasing.   At the strain rate of 5 × 10-5 s-1, the flow stress of as-received DAFA29 was 445 MPa which is almost twice that of TMT DAFA29 of 292 MPa.  When the strain rate is jumped to 5 × 10-2 s-1, the flow stress of as-received DAFA29 was 829 MPa, which is less than that of TMT DAFA29 of 1080 MPa. 
￼

4.3.3 Strain Rate Influence on Microstructures
            In order to understand the fracture behavior of as-received DAFA29 at different strain rates, tensile tests of as-received DAFA29 alloys were performed at 700ºC for selected strain rates (5 × 10-6 s-1, 5 × 10-4 s-1, and 5 × 10-2 s-1). The resulting true stress-strain curves are shown in Figure 4.6. The flow stresses are comparable to the results from the strain rate jump test results shown in Figure 4.5. Both the yield strength and work-hardening rate increase with increasing strain rate.  A summary of the yield strengths and work-hardening rates is shown in Table 4.2.

            TEM observations were used in order to investigate the dislocation distributions at 700ºC.  Figure 4.7 shows bright field (BF) TEM images for the samples tested at different strain rates.  The sample (Figure 4.7a) tested at 5 × 10-2 s-1 has the highest dislocation density compared to the other two samples.  The high dislocation density in Figure 4.7a effectively enhanced the dislocation interactions which created additional barriers in the lattice for slip. These barriers produced the high work hardening rate observed at this strain rate (Figure 4.6).  For the lower strain rates, the dislocation density was also lower.  The samples tested at both 5 × 10-4 and 5 × 10-6 s-1 show no work hardening and lower dislocation densities. The dislocations in Figure 4.7a are observed to align along one direction. This might be due to the high strain rate during the tensile test.
            In Figure 4.7c, Fe2Nb Laves phase and NiAl precipitates are present. These precipitates are located on grain boundaries and they are generated during the low strain rate test.  Small (~26 nm) spherical L12-Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates are also uniformly distributed in the f.c.c. matrix. The dislocations show strong interactions with these L12 precipitates. Numerous dislocation loops around L12 precipitates are present.  The pinning effects of the precipitates result in the observed wavy dislocations.  On the grain boundaries, numerous dislocations are crowded around the Fe2Nb Laves phase suggesting that the Laves phase precipitates are very strong obstacles to dislocation motion.

            In the sample tested at strain rate of 5 × 10-6 s-1, multiple slip features were observed in the grain boundary Laves phase precipitates. These slip features are speculated to be formed during the high temperature tensile tests at this slow strain rate.  The slip bands are ~100 nm wide, see Figure 4.8a.  All these slip features are aligned along &lt;10-10&gt;.  Figure 4.8b shows a select area diffraction pattern from this precipitate. The zone axis is [11-20]. These slip features are expected to be on the basal planes [56]. In order to confirm this, the Laves phase precipitate was characterized at different diffraction conditions. 
            Figure 4.8c, d and e show BF TEM images of the Laves phase precipitate observed at different zone axis. When viewed along both [11-20] and [1-100] the slip features are observed as lines, see Figure 4.8c and 4.8d, Viewing along the [10-11] (Figure 12e), those features became slip bands. By orienting these features corresponding to the [11-20] zone axis based on SAD patterns, we confirm these stacking faults are on the basal planes of the Laves phase. The fringes in both Figure 4.8c and d are the edge on of these parallel planer features. The white arrows in Figure 4.8e shows one of these features with a partial dislocation at the end of one or multiple stacking faults.  This is similar to previous observation of stacking faults and bounding dislocations in other C14 structures such as Cr-Ta and Cr-Nb system [56, 57], Cr-Ti and Cr-Hf system [56, 58]

4.4	Discussion
            At 700ºC, the yield strength of as-received DAFA29 is 523 MPa and it is slightly lower than its room temperature yield strength 560MPa [47]. It work-hardens significantly with an elongation of 20 % at room temperature, while it shows low work-hardening rate at 700ºC with an elongation of 28 %.  
            The TMT alloys show lower yield strength (~390 MPa) but higher elongation compared to the as-received DAFA29, see Figure 1 and 4.  It is evident that the TMTs which result in a fine grain size significantly improve the room temperature properties, but this grain size strengthening is negligible at 700ºC.  In room temperature, assuming off-set stress σ0 is constant for all TMT alloys, the estimate grain size strengthening effect is ~600 MPa according to the △σ = KD-1/2 [47, 59]. 
            As the temperature increased to 700ºC, the grain boundary strengthening effect became negligible due to the weakness of the grain boundaries. The high volume of grain boundaries in the TMT alloys are unable to block the motion of dislocations. For the 2.4 h annealed samples, the TMT Method#1 alloy still showed higher strength than TMT Method#2 alloy at 700ºC although it has more grain boundaries (smaller grain size).  This is mainly because the high temperature strength of TMT alloys has a strengthening contribution from the small Laves phase precipitates as well as the grain boundaries. The Laves phase precipitates in TMT Method#1 alloys are in the range of 167 ± 37 nm which is slightly smaller than it is in TMT Method#2 alloys (175 ± 45 nm) [47]. 
            For all the annealed specimens, the 2.4 h and 24 h annealed TMT method#1 alloys shows higher yield strength compared to TMT Method#2 alloys due to a smaller grain size. When the annealing time was increased to 240 h, TMT Method#2 alloys have higher strength than TMT Method#2. This might be due to an increase in the volume fraction of the Laves phase during the long time aging process. After 240 h aging, the large Laves phase precipitates in TMT Method#2 alloys are not present.  Instead smaller Laves phase are precipitated out with size of ~560 nm [47]. In TMT Method#1 alloys, there are still large Laves phase precipitate present in the microstructure
            The following section will discuss the strain rate sensitivity of the as-received and TMT DAFA29. The deformation mechanism at elevated temperature will also be discussed based on the flow stress and strain rate for each alloy. Table 4.3 summarizes the flow stress at different strain rates for the as-received and TMT DAFA29 alloys.

* The flow stress is the peak stress at each strain rate and temperature for all the alloys.
            At 600ºC, which is &lt;0.5Tm (Tm is 1365ºC for as-received DAFA29), the L12 precipitates in the as-received DAFA29 are fine (~10 nm) due to the slow coarsening rate at this temperature. There is a strong dislocations cutting of forest dislocations and dislocation shearing of precipitates. This dislocation cutting and shearing results in a stress independent of the strain rate with a low strain rate sensitivity of 0.02.  As the grain size decreases into the nano-size range for the TMT alloys, the rate-limiting process is increasingly influenced by the interactions of grain boundaries with dislocations, due to thermally activated dislocation annihilation at grain boundaries [60]. This results in a larger strain rate sensitivity for all TMT alloys even at 600ºC.
            At 700°C (&gt;0.5Tm), the L12 precipitates coarsened to a larger size (~30 nm) during the slow strain rate testing process. The dominant mechanism changed to dislocation looping and dislocation precipitate interaction stress decreased due to L12 coarsening. At this temperature, the work hardening is negligible. The reduction of work hardening in DAFA29 is due to a softening mechanism such as dynamic recovery which is prominent at elevated temperature [61]. This lower strengthening effect and loss of work hardening resulted in higher strain rate sensitivity m of 0.12. The precipitate coarsening during the strain rate jump testing affects the f low stress behavior.
4.4.1 Strain Rate Sensitivity
The flow stress and strain rate are typically related at a constant elevated temperature by the following equation:
￼                                                          (4.1)
where C is a constant,  is the flow stress,￼ is the strain rate, and m is the strain rate sensitivity parameter.
            Based on the flow stress results shown in Table 4.3, the flow stress is plotted as a function of strain rate on a log-log scale in Figure 4.9. The strain rate sensitivity m can be obtained from 
￼                                                            (4.2)
            The m value can be obtained based on a linear fit as shown in Figure 4.9. m of as-received DAFA29 is 0.12, while the values for TMT DAFA29 is 0.18 (Method#1) and 0.19 (Method#2), i.e. the yield stresses of the TMT DAFA29 alloys are more sensitive to strain rate compared to the as-received DAFA29 at 700ºC. The slight difference in m values for TMT Method#1 and Method#2 is probably due to different grain sizes [47].  At 600ºC m for as-received DAFA29 is 0.02, whereas the m values for the TMT AFA alloys are 0.08 (Method#1) and 0.09 (Method#2).  All the m values obtained at 600ºC are much smaller than those obtained at 700ºC, indicating that the strain rate sensitivity is influenced by the temperature for all tested alloys.
            At both 600ºC and 700ºC, the alloys treated by Method#2 with a grain size of ~200 nm have a slightly higher m than alloys treated by Method#1. Alloys treated by Method#1 have a grain size of ~100 nm which is about half size of alloys treated by Method#2.  It shows an increase in strain rate sensitivity with decreasing grain size.  This trend has also been observed in other nanocrystalline alloys [62, 63].
            At the same testing temperature, the strain rate sensitivity is larger for the smaller nano-sized grains in the TMT alloys compared to coarse grains of ~40 µm for the as-received DAFA29. A number of models [62, 64, 65] indicate the grain size dependence of the strain rate sensitivity is related to a decrease in the activation volume V.

            The strain rate sensitivity m can also be expressed as [63, 64, 66]:
￼                                                      (4.3)
where k, T, V and σ are Boltzman constant, absolute temperature, activation volume and yield/flow stress, respectively. 
           The activation volume V is broadly defined as the rate of decrease of activation enthalpy with respect to the flow stress at a fixed temperature. It influences the rate-controlling mechanisms in the plastic deformation of engineering metals and alloys [63]. Based on analysis of the activation volume, one may suggest a hypothesis about the controlling deformation mechanisms in the TMT alloys. The value of V is some two orders of magnitude smaller for nanocrystalline metals than for microcrystalline metals [63]. 
            The activation volume V can be calculated based on equations 4.2 and 4.3. A plot of log (￼)/log (σ) as function of σ has a slope of V/￼ and activation volumes can be obtained based on the value of the slope.  The activation volume for metals is normally expressed in terms of b3, where b is the shortest burgers vector of a perfect dislocation. In f.c.c. iron the burgers vector is 0.253 nm [67]. The calculated activation volumes for DAFA29 at 700ºC is 1.1 b3 (65 b3 at 600 ºC), while the values for the TMT alloys are 0.7 b3 (Method#1) and 0.8 b3 (Method#2), respectively. The activation volume for the fine grained TMT alloys is smaller than that of the coarse-grained alloys. Dislocations have a higher activation barrier when the grain size enters the nanometer regime. This is similar to other alloys tested at both room temperature and elevated temperature [60, 67, 68]. The mechanisms related with low activation volumes in nano grain materials are thought to be associated with thermally activated diffusion processes at the grain boundaries [69]. 
4.4.2 Deformation Mechanisms
            The relationship between strain rate and stress of the precipitation-strengthened alloys at elevated temperature can be described by a power law [17, 70, 71]:
￼                                                          (4.4)
where G is the shear modulus (MPa), b is the Burgers vector (nm), D is the diffusion coefficient of the f.c.c. matrix (m2/s), k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature (K), and n is the stress exponent. A stress exponent n in the range of 3-5 is typical for solid solution alloys.  Specifically, n is 5 for nickel and nickel-chromium alloys [58, 70, 72].  For precipitate-strengthened alloys, the n values obtained are normally larger than the solid solution alloys [71]. The high stress exponent arising from small dispersed precipitates being obstacles to the movement of dislocations [73, 74].
            In order to reduce the high stress exponent values, a threshold stress term σt is introduced into equation 4.4 to account for the influence of the precipitates. The effective stress is defined as σ - σt. Thus, equation 4.4 can be rewritten as:
￼                                                       (4.5)
            The value of the threshold stress σt depends on the dislocation precipitate interaction mechanism.  The mechanism could be dislocation cutting, Orowan looping, or dislocation climb. This value can be determined using the methodology suggested by Lagneborg and Bergman [75].  Basically, equation 4.5 can be rewritten:
￼                                                       (4.6)
            The threshold stress σt can be obtained from a plot of ￼ as a function of σ, as shown in Figure 4.10 and the threshold stress is the x-intercept. The threshold stress obtained using this method is 217 MPa for as-received DAFA29 at 700ºC, which is similar to the threshold stress value measured in another AFA alloy tested at the same temperature [17].  The threshold stresses are 50 MPa (Method#1) and 9 MPa (Method#2) for the TMT alloys tested at 700ºC.  These values increase to 670 MPa (Method#1) and 574 MPa (Method#2) for the TMT alloys tested at 600ºC.  Table 4.4 provides a summary of threshold stresses for the different processing conditions.  The threshold stress of alloys treated by Method#1 is slightly larger than that of Method#2 for both temperatures. The value of the threshold stress decreased significantly with an increase in temperature, and is almost zero for alloys treated by Method#2 at higher temperature.

            Figure 4.11 shows a plot of strain rate as a function of effective stress (σ - σt) for the as-received and TMT DAFA29 alloys. The corrected n value is 4.2 for the as-received DAFA29 tested at 700ºC which is close to the stress exponent value of another AFA alloy reported in [17].  At 600ºC, the n values of treated alloys decrease to 4.9 and 5.0 which are typical of n values for solid solution alloys [76]. 
￼
Figure 4.11 Strain rate as a function of the effective stress (σ - σt) for as-received and TMT DAFA29 alloys. The plots are on log-log scales.
            The extrapolated threshold stresses of the treated alloys at 600ºC are much higher than those obtained at 700ºC. They decrease significantly with the increase in temperature of 100ºC. Three possible mechanisms are considered to explain the threshold stress in precipitation-strengthened alloys: 1) precipitate cutting,  2) Orowan dislocation bowing, 3) dislocation climbing [76] . 
            The Orowan dislocation bowing stress for dislocation interact with Ni3(Al,Ti) particles is 
￼                                                                (4.7)   
where τo  is the shear stress necessary for precipitates bypass by Orowan bowing,  L is particle spacing, r is the radius of precipitates.  
            At 700ºC, the average size of Ni3(Al, Ti) precipitates is 35 nm after an 800ºC anneal for 2.4 h.  The particle spacing obtained based on L and the volume fraction is 140 nm [47]. The volume fraction of L12 phase can be calculated based on density and phase fraction from a JMatPro simulation shown in Figure 4.12.  G is approximately 50 GPa for AFA alloys and b is estimate to be 0.253 nm.  The calculated Orowan shear stress is about 180 MPa for both TMT AFA alloys.  The threshold stress values of TMT alloys are about 0.3τo (50 MPa for Method#1) and 0.05τo (9 MPa for Method#2).  These values are similar to those obtained from the Arzt-Ashby model for the local climb and general climb mechanisms [77].  For as-received DAFA29, the calculated Orowan shear stress is about 212 MPa with a particle spacing of 120 nm and average particle size of 30 nm. This Orowan stress is consistent with the threshold stresses of as-received DAFA29, which is 217 MPa. 
            At 600ºC, the threshold stress values are much higher than Orowan shear stress for both TMT alloys. This might be due to a change to a precipitate shearing mechanism and a higher volume fraction of Ni3(Al,Ti) at this temperature (Figure 4.12).
￼

             The activation energy (Q) can be determined by assuming that strain rate follows an Arrhenius type relationship [70, 78]:
￼                                                   (4.8)
where A is a constant, R is the gas constant and n is the stress exponent. This equation can be converted to the following equation [78]. 
￼                                        (4.9)
The activation energy under a constant strain rate can be calculated based on the above equation.  Q/(R·n) is the slope of lnσ plotted as a function of 1/T.  Figure 4.13 shows the plot of lnσ as a function of 1/T for as-received DAFA29 and TMT alloys at strain rate of 5 × 10-5 s-1. Based on the calculation, the activation energy for as-received DAFA29 is 124 kJ/mol. The activation energies of the TMT alloys are 409 kJ/mol for Method#1 and 491 kJ/mol for Method#2, respectively. The activation energy of as-received DAFA29 is similar to other AFA alloys studied by Zhou et al. [17].  The activation energy is slightly larger than other AFA alloys and austenite steels. But this high activation energy is also found in other superalloys such as alloy 617 [70] and IN 718 [79]. Such large values of activation energy can be reduced to 248–251 kJ/mol when considering the effective stress instead of the applied stress [80].

4.4.3 Dynamic Strain Aging of DAFA29
            At 600ºC, the yield stress of as-received DAFA29 is insensitive to the strain rate, as shown in Figure 4.5a.   The flow stress curve shows evidence of negative strain rate sensitivity with significant serrated flow.  This serrated flow starts when the strain rate jumps from 5 × 10-5 to 5 × 10-4 s-1.  This phenomenon is also observed for other stainless steels and high temperature superalloys [61, 81-84].  The serrated flow is expected to be associated with dynamic strain aging (DSA) which occurs at certain combinations of temperature and strain rate [81, 84].  The occurrence of DSA is the result of solute diffusion in the metal lattice during plastic deformation at certain temperatures.  The accumulation of these solute elements can impede the movement of dislocations and results in serrated flow curves.  The solute elements typically responsible for this behavior are carbon below 550ºC, and Cr or Mo at temperatures above 550ºC [84, 85].
4.4.4 DAFA29 is Insensitive to Strain Rate at 600ºC
            The yield stress of DAFA29 is not dependent on the strain rate at 600ºC.  This might be related to the work hardening of DAFA29 at this temperature.  At 700ºC or higher, there is little work hardening for DAFA29 as shown in Figure 4.1 and 4.3.  The reduction of work hardening in as-received DAFA29 at temperature of  700ºC and higher temperature is due to a softening mechanism such as dynamic recovery which is expected to become the dominant mechanism at elevated temperature [61]. At higher temperatures, the work hardening due to the increase in dislocation density with increasing strain is counteracted by the formation of subgrains with low energy dislocations. Thermally-activated climb of dislocations is the prominent dynamic recovery mechanism for precipitate-strengthened alloys. This will overcome the obstacles of dislocation motion which is restrained at the lower temperature of 600ºC. This is also influenced by strain rate during tensile tests since the recovery is diffusion controlled process  [61]. 
4.5	Conclusions
            In this chapter, the recently-developed AFA alloy, DAFA29, was treated by two TMT methods.  The resulting fine-grained alloys were tensile tested at elevated temperatures.  Their mechanical properties were also evaluated by strain rate jump tests at two different temperatures.  These results were compared to data for the as-received AFA alloy. The findings of this research are summarized as follows:
1.	The TMT didn’t increase the yield strengths of AFA alloys at 700ºC, although it significantly enhanced the yield strength of AFA alloys at room temperature.
2.	The TMT AFA alloys have higher strain rate sensitivity and lower activation volume compared to as-received DAFA29 at elevated temperatures. The higher strain rate sensitivity and lower activation volume are due to the nanocrystalline grain size of the alloys. 
3.	For the two TMT AFA alloys, the strain rate and stress satisfy a power law relationship with the stress exponent around 5, whereas the stress exponent is around 4 for the as-received DAFA29. These values ruled out the mechanisms of bulk diffusion (Nabarro-Herring mechanism) and grain boundary diffusion (Coble mechanism) to explain the flow behavior.
4.	At 700ºC, dislocation climb is the dominant mechanism for deformation of TMT alloys. When the temperature decrease to 600ºC, the mechanism changes to dislocation shearing as indicated by the dramatically increased threshold stress. 
5.	The yield stress of TMT alloys decrease rapidly from 600ºC to 700ºC, which might be because increased diffusion rates in TMT alloys lead to fast dislocation climb at 700ºC. At this temperature, dislocation will be able to move around obstacles easily and the large volume of grain boundaries in TMT alloys work as sites of weakness.
6.	The flow stress of the as-received AFA alloy is insensitive to strain rate at 600ºC due to strong work hardening at this temperature. It also shows significant serrated flow on the stress strain curve, which is associated with dynamic strain aging effect.
















Chapter 5 Characterization of the Aging of Alumina-forming Austenitic Alloys
5.1	Introduction
            The current chapter investigates the effects of aging on the microstructures and mechanical properties of the recently-developed AFA stainless steels, DAFA26 and DAFA29, which are Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-3Al-2Ti-based alloys. We explored the effects of aging time on the microstructures of alloys, specifically on the precipitation of Fe2Nb Laves phase and B2-NiAl on the grain boundaries and L12 in f.c.c. matrix, in an attempt to further improve the mechanical properties of AFA stainless steels. The effects of boron and carbon additions on the microstructures and various precipitates are discussed.
5.2	Experimental
          The materials used for these studies were as-received DAFA26 and DAFA29. The compositions and fabrication of these two AFA alloys were described in Chapter 2. The difference between the recently-developed alumina-forming austenitic alloys DAFA26 and DAFA29 is the carbon and boron content: DAFA29 has 0.1 wt.% of carbon and 0.01 wt.% of boron, whereas DAFA26 has neither. Both of the alloys were annealed at 800°C for 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h. The microstructural characterization and mechanical testing methods were presented in Chapter 2. 
            Twin density, defined as the number of twin boundary intercepts per unit length, was calculated using [86, 87]:
￼
where Ltb is the total length of twin boundaries and S is the corresponding surface area of grains. 
            The coverage of precipitation in grain boundary was measured quantitatively by using equation 5.2 [45, 46].
￼
where ρ is the area fraction of the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates in the grain boundaries,  l and n are the lengths of the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates, respectively , and L is the length of the grain boundaries on 2-D sections. Measurements were performed on 10 BSE images of mechanically polished samples with a total grain boundary length of about 1 mm.
5.3	Results
5.3.1 Microstructures
            Figure 5.1a and b shows the microstructures of as-received DAFA26 and DAFA29, respectively. The grain size of DAFA26 is ~30 µm while that of DAFA29 is ~40 µm.  The white contrast precipitates in DAFA26 are Laves phase. All the Laves phase precipitates in DAFA26 are aligned in the hot rolling direction and have an elongated shape. No other precipitates were observed in DAFA26. The white contrast precipitates in DAFA29 are both Laves phase and MC carbides. The MC carbides normally have blocky shape with sharp-edged geometry, while the Laves phase precipitates have a elongated granular shape due to hot rolling process. These two precipitates can also be differentiated based on EDS results: EDS spectra of Laves phase and MC carbides in DAFA29 are shown in Figure 5.1c and d. 
            Twins were also observed in many grains in as-received DAFA26. The calculated twin boundary density in DAFA26 is 22 ± 4 /mm (28 twin boundaries counted).  Almost no twin boundaries were observed in as-received DAF29.

Figure 5.1 BSE images of as-received DAFA26 (a) and DAFA29 (b). (c) and (d) are EDS spectra of the Laves phase and MC carbide precipitates in (b). No MC carbides are present in DAFA26.
            The microstructures of DAFA26 and DAFA29 are shown in Figure 5.2 after aging for 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h at 800°C.  There is no obvious grain growth for either DAFA26 or DAFA29 after these aging times. Twins were still observed in 240 h-aged DAFA26, but the twin boundary density was reduced to 16 ± 3 /mm (32 twin boundaries counted). Again, no twins were observed in aged DAFA29. The morphology and size of Laves phase (bright contrast) precipitates in DAFA26 didn’t change during the aging process. The MC carbides still have the blocky shape with sharp-edged geometry. The average size of MC carbides also didn’t increase after 240 h aging. 
            As the aging time was increased, more and more grain boundary precipitates are observed in both DAFA26 and DAFA29. This is particularly evident for the alloys aged for 240 h as shown in Figure 5.2e and f. The grain boundary in DAFA29 is almost fully covered with these precipitates.  
            The small needle shape precipitates (indicated by yellow arrows) in the f.c.c. matrix of 240 h-aged DAFA26 and DAFA29 are co-precipitates of Laves phase and B2-NiAl phase based on EDS analysis. They formed randomly inside matrix after 240 h aging.

            Figure 5.3 shows high magnification BSE images of the grain boundary precipitates after aging at 800°C for different times. Figure 5.3a, c and e show BSE images of aged DAFA26 after aging times of 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h. As the aging time increases, more Laves phase (bright contrast) and B2-NiAl (dark contrast) precipitates are formed on grain boundaries. The two precipitates are also identified by EDS in SEM. For the sample aged for 240 h, the grain boundaries are largely covered with the precipitates of Laves and B2-NiAl phase.  The grain boundary coverage for this sample is 83 % according the calculation method described in experimental section. 
            Similar phenomena were also observed for DAFA29 as shown in Figure 5.3b, d, and f.  As the aging time increase, more and more Laves phase, B2-NiAl precipitates are formed on the grain boundaries. No small MC carbides are observed on grain boundaries based on EDS analysis in SEM. As the aging time increased to 240 h, Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates are densely packed in the grain boundaries in 240 h-aged DAFA29.  The grain boundary precipitate coverage is 94 % according to the same method we used for DAFA26.  The grain boundary precipitate in 240 h-aged DAFA29 has higher coverage than it is in DAFA26.

            In order to further determine the size of Laves phase precipitates and B2-NiAl in grain boundaries of 240 h-aged DAFA26 and DAFA29, samples were mechanical polished and characterized in SEM. BSE images of grain boundaries of 240 h-aged DAFA26 and DAFA29 are shown in Figure 5.4a and b. The lighter contrast particles in the grain boundaries are the Laves phase and the darker contrast particles in the grain boundaries are the B2-NiAl precipitates. 
            A statistical analysis was performed to characterize the size and size distribution of the Laves phase and B2-NiAl in the grain boundaries. The size distribution histograms of the Laves phase particles are shown in Figure 5.4c and d for 240 h-aged DAFA26 and DAFA29, respectively. The average size (defined as equivalent diameter sphere) of Laves phase is 326 ± 64 nm in DAFA26 which is 11 % larger than in DAFA29 (294 ± 57 nm).  The histograms of the B2-NiAl are shown in Figure 5.4e and f for 240 h-aged DAFA26 and DAFA29. The average size is 363 ± 152 nm in DAFA26, while it is 304 ± 114 nm in DAFA29.

(N stands for the number of particles counted and ± means the standard deviation of the particle size.)

           The coarsening behavior of the L12 phase present in the matrix was investigated using the SEM. Figure 5.5 shows SE images of the spherical L12 particles in all the aged alloys. The morphology of L12 particles is still spherical after 240 h aging at 800ºC. As the aging time increases from 2.4h to 240h, the L12 phase had obviously grow.  Based on statistical analysis, the particle size (average diameter) of L12 particles in DAFA26 increases from 36 ± 4 nm to 124 ± 30 nm after aging for 240 h, while the L12 particles in DAFA29 grow from 35 ± 7 nm to 124 ± 28 nm. Histograms of the L12 particle size in DAFA26 and DAFA29 at each aging time are shown in Figure 5.6.  The sizes of L12 particles are similar in both DAFA26 and DAFA29 for each aging time. The additions of boron and carbon in DAFA29 have no evident influence on the size and morphology of L12 particles. The size and stable shape of L12 is beneficial to the mechanical properties of AFA alloys during long time service at high temperature.

            In order to study the lattice parameters in the two alloys, synchrotron XRD experiments were performed on the aged samples of these two alloys. 
            Figure 5.7 shows synchrotron XRD results of aged DAFA26 and aged DAFA29.  Both alloys show large characteristic peaks, such as 111, 002 and 022, which arise from both the L12 particles and f.c.c. matrix since the lattice constants of these two phases are very close to each other. The changes of peak intensity between different specimens likely arises not from differences in texture but because the X-ray slit size used was only 100 µm ×100 µm and, thus, the X-ray peaks includes information from only ~10 grains).  The small peaks observed in both DAFA26 and DAFA29 are from the L12, B2-NiAl, and Laves phase precipitates.
            X-ray peaks from the L12, B2-NiAl, and Laves phase can be more clearly identified in the small angle region (2 range from 9-18o) for all the aged samples as shown in Figure 5.7c and d.  No peaks from MC carbides were observed in any aged DAFA29 samples. This is likely because of the low volume fraction of this phase (much less than 1 wt.% based on JMatPro simulation). The peak height of the Laves phase in aged DAFA29 is much lower than that in aged DAFA26, while the peak height of the L12 phase is similar for both alloys. This result is consistent with our previous SEM observations of the volume fractions of the Laves phase and L12 precipitates. A peak from B2-NiAl phase is not clearly evident until after 240 h aging. This indicates most of B2-NiAl precipitates were formed during 24 h to 240 h aging.
            The calculated lattice parameters of each phase at each aging time are shown in Table 5.1. The lattice misfit between the f.c.c and L12 phases is less than 0.2 % for all the aged AFA alloys. The lattice parameters of B2-NiAl in aged DAFA29 appear to increase with increased annealing time. However, it is worth noting that determination of lattice parameters from low angle peaks is not very accurate. 
There are no differences in the lattice parameters of the various phases in DAFA 26 compared to DAFA 29 except, possibly, for the f.c.c. matrix, which is larger in DAFA29.  This suggests that the boron in DAFA29 may also reside in the matrix.

            Figure 5.8 shows BSE and TEM images of discontinuous precipitation (or cellular growth) of the B2-NiAl phase in 2.4 h-aged DAFA26. Discontinuous precipitation was found in DAFA26 annealed for both 2.4 h and 24 h, but not for 240 h.  The precipitation was found to be common throughout all the grain boundaries for short time aged DAFA26 (2.4 h and 24 h) microstructures examined. No preferred boundary misorientation for precipitation was found.  It has large influence on the grain boundary morphology as shown in Figure 5.8a. TEM EDS results are shown in Figure 5.8c. These precipitates are rich of Ni, Fe, Cr and Al.  This discontinuous precipitation was not found in any aged DAFA29 alloys based on SEM and TEM observations.

          Figure 5.9 shows the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates in a grain boundary of 240 h-aged DAFA29. EDS spectra of the three grain boundary precipitates are shown in Figure 5.9b, c and d. A small peak of boron is detected in the EDS spectrum for the Laves phase precipitate and the peak is located at 0.18 keV. No boron peak was detected in the two EDS spectra from the B2-NiAl precipitates.  In the EDS from the f.c.c. matrix, a carbon peak was detected at 0.28 keV. No carbon peak was found in the grain boundary precipitates. 
            Precipitate free zones (PFZ), with a width of 200 nm, are clearly observed around the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates. This zone connects grain boundary precipitates and f.c.c. matrix.  It lacks the precipitate strengthening from L12 precipitates compared to the f.c.c. matrix. EDS results from PFZ and f.c.c. matrix are shown in Figure 5.9e and f. These results show the microchemistry of the PFZ is mainly composed of Fe, Ni and Cr, while the f.c.c. matrix is composed of Fe, Ni, and Al. The f.c.c. matrix has more Ni, Al and Ti than the PFZ. This is because of the spherical L12-Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates present in the f.c.c. matrix. There are almost no L12-Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates observed in the PFZ.

5.3.2 Mechanical Properties
            Tensile testing of the aged DAFA26 and DAFA29 was carried out at 700ºC at an initial strain rate of 5 × 10-4 s-1. The resulting stress-strain curves are shown in Figure 5.10.  Both AFA alloys show much higher yield strength after 2.4 h aging compared to the as-received alloys. Among all the aged samples, the maximum strength was achieved after aging for 2.4 h. The yield strength decreased after aging for longer times. 
            For DAFA26, as the annealing time increased from 2.4 h to 240 h, the yield strength decreased from 700 MPa to 485 MPa. The yield strength of 2.4 h aged DAFA26 is similar to 24 h aged DAFA26. As the annealing time increased from 2.4 h to 240 h, the yield strength of DAFA29 decreased from 731 MPa to 514 MPa after 240 h aging.  The yield strength of DAFA29 decreased gradually upon annealing for longer times. The elongation of all aged DAFA9 only changed slightly, while the elongation for aged DAFA29 increased with aging time. A summary of yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation for aged DAFA26 and DAFA29 is shown in Table 5.2.

            Figure 5.11 shows the fracture surfaces for 240 h-aged DAFA26 and DAFA29, respectively.  Both of the fracture surfaces shows dimples feature. This indicates the fracture modes for both aged alloys are ductile failure.

5.4	Discussion
5.4.1 Precipitates
           The morphology and sizes of L12 precipitates in all the aged DAFA26 and DAFA29 are similar at the same aging times based on SEM, TEM and statistical analysis, i.e. the L12 precipitates shows the same coarsening behavior during aging from 2.4 h to 240 h for both alloys. The addition of boron and carbon has no significant effects on the lattice parameter, morphology and size of L12 precipitates in the AFA alloys. After 240 h aging, the morphology of L12 is still spherical due to the low lattice misfit (~0.2 %) between f.c.c matrix and L12 phase. A similar result has also been observed in other f.c.c. alloy systems. Wang et al. [88] investigated the effect of boron addition on the coarsening of γ’ phase in Ni-Fe based superalloy. The results indicated adding boron having no obvious influence on γ’ coarsening behavior. 
            The average diameter (d) of the L12 precipitates is plotted against the aging time as shown in Figure 5.12. The L12 size increases as aging time increased for both aged DAFA26 and DAFA29. There is a linear relationship between dt3 - d03 and t, where d0 is the average diameter of the L12 phase in the as-received alloys (~10 nm). This linear relationship suggests coarsening of the L12 precipitates follows the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) model (dt3 ∝ t). Although the LSW model is strictly applicable when the precipitate volume fraction is very small, the cubic growth kinetics of the L12 particles has been observed in many superalloys [88-90]. The LSW model predicts time dependent coarsening behavior of the L12 particles by the following equations [89]:
￼ (5.3)
￼                                                   (5.4)
where t is the aging time, dt is the L12 particle size at the time of t, k is the coarsening rate which depends on several parameters, γ is the interfacial energy between the precipitate and f.c.c. matrix, Vm is the molar volume fraction of L12 precipitates, D is the diffusion coefficient of the solute, Cm is the atomic fraction of solute in equilibrium with the precipitate, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The coarsening rate of the L12 particles in aged DAFA26 is similar to that of DAFA29 which suggests the coarsening kinetics of the L12 phase in both DAFA26 and DAFA29 are similar and follow the LSW model.
￼
Figure 5.12 A plot of L12 size versus aging time for both DAFA26 and DAFA29
            The grain boundary precipitates (Laves phase and B2-NiAl) also coarsened during the aging from 2.4 h to 240 h. It seems the coarsening rate of the grain boundary precipitates in aged DAFA26 and DAFA29 is slightly different. In 240 h-aged DAFA29, the grain boundary has 10% more precipitate coverage than that in DAFA26 according our measurements. The average particle size of both Laves phase and B2-NiAl in 240 h-aged DAFA29 is smaller than it is in DAFA26 based on statistic analysis. This indicates that boron in DAFA29 influences the distribution and inhibits the coarsening of the grain boundary precipitates.  That boron suppress the coarsening of grain boundary precipitates was also observed in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at.%) alloy [91, 92], Ni-Fe alloy [88, 93], and Nickel based superalloy (617B) [94]. 
            The blocky MC carbides and Laves phase in the matrix of DAFA29 were very stable during the aging process, i.e. there was no significant change of size and morphology observed after 240 h annealing.
5.4.2 Discontinuous Precipitation
            Discontinuous precipitation (or cellular growth) was found in the 2.4h and 24h aged DAFA26 specimen. BSE and BF TEM images in Figure 5.9 revealed colonies of aligned lamellar precipitates at the grain boundaries.  The precipitation reaction also influenced the morphology of grain boundaries, such that the latter appeared serrated or distorted.  The curvature of the grain boundaries was observed to curve back into the grain. This discontinuous precipitation has also been observed in a Fe-Ni-Cr-Nb (4.85 wt.% Nb) alloy [95] and [96], in another austenitic steel containing Nb [97]. It was also found recently in the nickel-based superalloy 718Plus [98].   Pickering et al. [98] discussed the mechanism for this discontinuous precipitation. It is driven by an overall reduction in free energy of the alloy system and is enabled by fast solute partitioning along the moving boundary [98]. This cellular phase is beneficial to prevent grain growth during aging and could improve the resistance to inter-granular fracture by pinning the grain boundaries. 
            No discontinuous precipitation was observed in DAFA29.  The boron and carbon additions in DAFA29 presumably suppress the discontinuous precipitation.  This suppression of discontinuous precipitate by boron has also been found in other alloys systems such as Cu-Ti alloys [99] and Ni-Fe alloys [88, 100]. This is possibly because diffusion of elements in grain boundaries was diminished by boron or the mobility of the transformation in front of the grain boundaries was reduced probably owing to pinning effect of boron segregates or other precipitates.
5.4.3 Precipitate Free Zone
          Precipitate free zones (PFZs) are also observed in aged DAFA29 between the grain boundary precipitates and the f.c.c. matrix. This zone can help to relieve stress concentrations on grain boundary precipitates. However, if the zone is too ductile or too wide, it may create large strain concentrations in grain boundary, resulting in enhanced grain boundary shear which may again lead to premature failure [101]. Baither et al. [102, 103] studied PFZ in polycrystalline γ’ strengthened nickel-based superalloy Nimonic PE16 using in-situ TEM. They confirmed that the PFZ will lower the yield strength only when PFZ’s width exceeds 1.7(L-r), where L is interparticle spacing and r is radius of the L12 particles. Beyond this width, dislocations are generated in PFZ and resulting dislocation pileups lead to the reduction of yield strength. For 240 h-aged DAFA29, the L12 volume fraction is 15.4 % and the average precipitate radius 62 nm. The calculated interparticle spacing L is around 228 nm based on following equation [38]:
￼                                                      (5.5)
where f is the volume fraction of L12 phase. The value of 1.7(L-r) is 278 nm, which is slightly larger than the width of PFZ in 240 h-aged DAFA29 (200 nm). Thus, according to Baither et al.’s analysis [102, 103], the PFZs in the 240 h-aged DAFA alloys are too narrow to produce softening.
5.4.4 Twinning
            Twins were observed in both as-received and annealed DAFA26, but not in DAFA29. Twin density is proportional to the driving force of the migrating boundaries. This driving force can be substantially changed by adding of impurities such as boron [104]. For example, a drastic reduction from 0.4 twins/grain to 0.1 twins/grain in twin density was reported in a nickel alloy due to the addition of 200 ppm boron [105]. Similarly, Mahajan et al. [106] also found that boron reduced 50 % of  twin density in annealed nickel.  The presence of boron in nickel poisons the grain boundaries [106]. Consequently, the grain boundary migration becomes difficult. Since grain boundary movements are necessary for twin formation, it is expected that the twin density in boron-containing alloys should be lower than that in boron-free specimens. 
            It is worth noting that after aging for 240 h, the twin density in DAFA26 decreased slightly from 22 /mm to 16 /mm. Annealing twins are generated mostly during recrystallization. In the grain growth regime, the evolution of annealing twin density is mainly determined by their propagation, the interaction or the disappearance of the existing twins. Twin boundaries move in order to minimize the total interfacial energy [86]. Jin et al. [87] presented evidence that the annealing twin density increases during recrystallization, but decreases during grain growth in pure nickel.
5.4.5 Mechanical Properties
            After aging 2.4 hours, both DAFA26 and DAFA29 achieved their highest yield strengths at 700ºC compared to samples aged at longer times. This indicates that the maximum strengthening effect from L12 precipitates can be obtained by aging less than 24 h (L12 particle diameter is less than 55 nm).  Figure 5.13 shows the yield strength and elongation as function of aging time.  The yield strength increased first and then decreased due to L12 precipitate coarsening. The elongation for both aged alloys decreased first and then increased. 
￼
Figure 5.13 Yield strength and elongation of DAFA26 and DAFA29 as a function of aging time
            In order to understand the origin of the yield strength obtained for all aged samples, we assume the yield strength was related to the grain size obtained, according to the Hall-Petch relationship:
σy= σ0 + KD-0.5                                                     (5.6)
where σ0 is the off-set stress, D is the average grain size, and K is a constant.  The off-set stress can be expressed by following equation [53]:
σ0 = σppt +σss                                                          (5.7)
where σppt is strengthening contribution due to the presence of L12 precipitates, σss is the strengthening contribution due to solid solution strengthening. σppt can be obtained from following equation [107]:
￼ (5.8)
where b is the Burgers vector with unit of nm, d is the particle diameter with unit of nm, f is the precipitate volume fraction with unit of % and 10.8 has unit of MPa·nm. The volume fraction of L12 Ni3Al precipitates is 15.4 % in DAFA29 is and 14.8 % in DAFA26 according to JMatPro simulation.
          The calculated σppt and KD-0.5 values are shown in Table 5.3 for both DAFA26 and DAFA29. σss is obtained by subtracting σppt and KD-0.5 values from the yield strength obtained from tensile testing. The solution strengthening values for 240 h-aged DAFA29 is higher than 240 h-aged DAFA26. This solution strengthening must be due to boron in the f.c.c. matrix.  The lattice parameter of f.c.c. matrix for 240 h-aged DAFA29 is also slightly larger than it is in 240h-aged DAFA26 presumably due to the boron.

            MC carbides are present in DAFA29 with a phase fraction much less than 1 wt. % according to JMatPro simulation. These probably have limited effect on the tensile strength of aged DAFA29 alloys. Yamatomo et al. [31] showed that only 0.1 wt.% carbon addition to alloy 41ZC (same as DAFA29) doesn’t have any significant influence on creep performance when compared to 41Z (same as DAFA26).
           240h-aged DAFA29 shows much higher elongation than 240h-aged DAFA26. This elongation difference might be due to the boron influence. It has been found previously that boron additions can increase the ductility of intermetallics and alloys [108, 109]. Wang et al.[88] found boron can improve the elongation by 50 % to 100 % of Fe-Ni alloys after standard heat treatments at temperature from 650ºC to 700ºC. The boron addition increased the grain boundary strength (increase of more obvious dimples) of these Fe-Ni alloys and optimized the M23C6 carbides distribution at grain boundaries.  Zhou et al. [110] found the boron doping of the nickel-based superalloy M951 increased its tensile elongation from 8 % to 28 % in tensile tests at 1100ºC. The boron increases the dislocation motion in the grain boundary and dissipates the strain at the head of dislocation pileups in the vicinity of grain boundaries. These will prevent premature micro-crack formation and consequently produce better ductility [110].  Chiu et al. [111] studied the effect of 0.5 at.% of boron doping on the mechanical properties γ/γ’ nickel-aluminum alloys. Boron doping caused &gt;30 % improvements in tensile elongation for the alloy after homogenization at 1100ºC and prolonged annealing at 1200ºC.  The ductility enhancement by boron has also been observed in other alloy system such as Co-Al-W high-temperature alloys during high temperature tensile tests [112].
            Figure 5.14a and b shows the grain boundary precipitates coverage and elongation as a function of aging time for both aged DAFA26 and DAFA29. The grain boundary precipitates coverage increased as the aging time increased for both DAFA26 and DAFA29. The elongation of DAFA29 also increased as the aging increased from 2.4 h to 240 h, while the elongation for DAFA26 increased first and decreased slightly.  Figure 5.14c shows the grain boundary coverage as a function of elongation for both aged DAFA26 and DAFA29. A correlation between grain boundary coverage and elongation for DAFA29 is found, but not for DAFA26. This might be associated to the boron segregating to the grain boundaries at longer aging times. It was found that boron is preferentially located at interface of matrix and grain boundary precipitates. Tytko et al. [94] detected boron is enriching at M23C6/γ interfaces in Nickel based superalloy (617B) using atom probe tomography (APT).  Li et al. [93] also found boron is preferentially located at phase interface of grain boundary precipitate Ni3Ti and f.c.c. in Ni-Fe alloy by using APT. These boron enrichments were also observed in Fe2Nb laves phase precipitates in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at.%) alloys [91, 92]. As the annealing time increases, grain boundary precipitate coverage will increase in DAFA29. With the coverage increase, more boron will segregate at these grain boundary precipitates interfaces and results in better ductility.

5.5 Conclusions 
1.	The largest strengthening effect from L12 precipitates can be obtained by aging less than 24 h for both AFA alloys. 
2.	During aging, the coarsening behavior of L12 precipitates was the same in both DAFA26 and DAFA29, i.e.: the addition of carbon and boron has no significant effects on the lattice parameter, morphology and size of L12 precipitates in the aged AFA alloys.
3.	Boron enhanced the grain boundary precipitates coverage and suppressed the coarsening of both Laves phase and B2-NiAl in the grain boundaries in AFA alloys
4.	The yield strength of both DAFA26 and DAFA29 decreased as aging time increased. The strength loss is mainly due to the coarsening of L12 precipitates. 
5.	The higher ductility 240h-aged DAFA29 is attributing to the boron addition. The boron increase grain boundary strength and optimize grain boundary precipitates distribution in grain boundaries.
6.	Boron addition in AFA alloys seems suppressed the formation of twins and discontinuous precipitation.  This is mainly due to the impurities impede the migration of grain boundary. 








Chapter 6 Characterizations of Creep Failure Samples of DAFA 29


6.1 Introduction
            In this Chapter, we analyzed DAFA29 specimen after creep failure using optical microscopy, a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The fracture surfaces and deformed cross-sectional surfaces were characterized using a SEM.  The mechanisms for creep failure are analyzed and discussed. 
6.2 Experimental

           The composition of test alloy (DAFA29) is shown in Table 2.1. Two sets of creep tests were performed at ORNL (Oak Ridge, TN) and Carpenter (Reading, PA).  The first creep testing condition was at 750°C and 100 MPa, and the second creep testing condition was at 700°C and 170 MPa. 
6.3 Results
            Figure 6.1a shows a DAFA29 sample after being creep tested at 750°C and 100 MPa.  It has an obvious necked region.  The material fractured at 5,282 h with 39.4% elongation and 44.4% reduction in area at the neck. Figure 6.1b shows an optical micrograph of the fracture surface (cross-sectional view) after creep failure. Figure 6.1c is the side view photograph of this fracture sample.  Many cracks are observed in the necked reign on the edge surface perpendicular to the stress applied direction. Figure 6.1d, e and f are images from the creep specimen tested at 700°C and 170 MP.  This specimen fractured at 8,000 h with a 29% reduction in area. There is no significant difference between the two specimens tested in the two conditions based on the optical microscope images.

          Figure 6.2 shows SE images of the fracture surfaces for the samples creep tested in the two conditions.  Figure 6.2a and b are SE images of creep sample tested at 750°C/100 MPa, while Figure 6.2c and d are for the creep sample tested at 700°C/170 MPa.  Although the specimen tested at 750°C/100 MPa show an elongation of 39.4% at fracture, some cleavage surfaces (as indicated by white arrows) were observed with cavities as shown in Figure 6.2a. These cleavage surfaces with dimples around them indicate it is a mix-fracture model. Figure 6.2b shows one of the cavities formed with a particle in the center in large magnification.  These microvoids (Figure 6b) were observed with a second phase particle such as Laves and/or MC carbides in the center.  The second phase particles are suspected to act as the void initiator to initiate the cracks. During creep, the cracks grow gradually and form the microvoids. The fracture surface of the specimen tested at 700°C/170 MPa is shown in Figure 6.2c. Although the applied stress was almost double, the fracture surface is still similar to specimen in Figure 6.2a with many grain facets (cleavage surfaces) indicating intergranular fracture.

            Figure 6.3 shows the crept region (Figure 6.3a) of the AFA sample tested at 750°C/100 MPa and its control sample (Figure 6.3b).  The control sample is the creep sample head which is simply annealed at 750ºC for 5282 h without any stress applied.  A large number of precipitates appeared in the matrix and grain boundaries for both two samples.  For most precipitates, the B2-NiAl phase coexists with the Laves phase. On the grain boundaries, the B2-NiAl phase and Laves phase precipitates alternately.  For the sample which was creep tested (Figure 6.3a), the large Laves phase precipitates fractured due to the stress applied. Small voids (dark spots in Figure 6.3 as indicated by yellow arrows) are observed for both two crept and control samples.  The number of voids in creep tested samples is more than in the control samples.  














￼
Figure 6.3 BSE images of the creep region (a) and a control sample (b). The sample was creep tested at 750°C/100 MPa, while the control sample is simply aged at 750°C for the same time. (The white arrow in (a) indicates the stress direction)
            Figure 6.4 shows BSE images of one of the cracked regions in DAFA 29 creep failure sample after creep testing at 750°C/100MPa.  Cracks are observed on the grain boundaries where small Laves phase and NiAl precipitates are located.  Most of the cracks initiated from the second phase precipitates and propagated along the grain boundaries where most of Laves and B2 phase precipitates exist.  The grain boundaries behave as a weak path for crack propagation. 
            Most of cracks are around the edge of NiAl and Laves phase precipitates, as shown in Figure 6.4a. A precipitates free zone (PFZ) is located on the edge of these precipitates. Cracks also go through some of NiAl precipitates as shown in Figure 6.4b (indicated by a yellow arrow). The NiAl has a solvus temperature around 800°C in DAFA29 system according to simulation by JMatPro software.  It is soft when creep tested at 750°C which is close to its solvus temperature. 
            There is a transgranular crack observed inside of grain as indicated by a yellow arrow in Figure 6.4a. In some of grain boundaries, cracks also exist even though there are no grain boundary precipitates. This is shown in the lower left corner of Figure 6.4b. No cracking of precipitates in f.c.c. matrix was observed for this specimen.

          The SEM was also used to characterize the microstructure of the sample tested at 700°C/170MPa. Figure 6.5 shows a comparison of microstructures of a crept sample and the corresponding control sample.  There are less grain boundary precipitates formed compare to the sample tested at 750°C/100MPa, see Figure 6.3, due to the lower testing temperature.  Fractured large Laves phase precipitates were not observed.

            Figure 6.6 shows the cracks in the crept region in DAFA29 after testing at 700°C/170 MPa.  The applied stress is almost double of the first test condition. Cracks in the grain boundary Laves phase were present as shown in both Figure 6.6a and b. Most of cracks propagate on the edge of precipitates where a PFZ is located. The PFZ is likely weak due to the lack of precipitates.

            Figure 6.7 show BSE images of electrochemically polished DAFA29 after creep testing at 750°C/100 MPa.  Laves and B2 phases appeared on the matrix surface due to the different electrochemical etching rates between them and the f.c.c. matrix. Spherical L12 precipitates are visible in the f.c.c. matrix and appear as the tiny spherical particles even though after 5282 h creep testing.  On the grain boundaries, there are Laves phase and B2-NiAl phase precipitates, and there is a clear PFZ between grain boundary precipitates and f.c.c. matrix.

            In order to see this PFZ at higher magnification, a TEM was used to perform further analysis. Figure 6.8 shows BF TEM image of a B2-NiAl precipitate and the PFZ around it.  The width of the B2-NiAl precipitate is around 750 nm, while the PFZ is almost the same width as the B2 precipitate. EDS results from PFZ and f.c.c. matrix are shown in Figure 6.8b and c. These results show the microchemistry of the PFZ is mainly composed of Fe, Ni and Cr, while f.c.c. matrix is composed of Fe, Ni, Cr and Al. The f.c.c. matrix has more Ni, Al and Ti than PFZ. This is due to many spherical L12-Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates exist in the f.c.c. matrix. There are almost no L12-Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates observed in this zone, while many L12 particles are located in the f.c.c. matrix with darker contrast.

6.4 Discussion 
            There are cracks observed in DAFA29 after creep testing at both two creep testing conditions (750°C/100 MPa and 700°C/170 MPa) as shown in Figure 6.4 and 6.6. It was found most of the cracks are associated the second phase precipitates in the grain boundaries. They propagate along the grain boundaries or PFZ where most of Laves phase and B2-NiAl phase precipitates exist.  The grain boundaries or PFZ behave as a weak path for crack propagation. This is also evident by the fracture surface as shown in Figure 6.2 with many grain facets indicating intergranular fracture. These Laves phase precipitated along the boundaries can improve the creep strength of the boundaries according to grain boundaries precipitate strengthening mechanism proposed by Takeyama et al. [45, 46]. However, the cracks were still initiated and propagated along the boundaries, which suggests that the boundaries are still the weaker regions for causing fracture of the DAFA29 during creep.
            A wide PZF (~750 nm half width) was observed using both a SEM and a TEM in the grain boundary region adjacent to Laves or B2-NiAl phase precipitates. The PFZ is only solid solution strengthened and softer than the f.c.c. matrix because lack of the precipitate strengthening from L12 precipitates. This zone can allow cracks to propagate more easily compared to in the Laves phase precipitates, B2 precipitates, or f.c.c. matrix. The presence of PFZ has been shown considerably reduce the time to failure in stress rupture tests at elevated temperature [113]. Venkiteswran et al. [101] studied the creep rupture properties of Inconel alloys X-750.  They found that precipitate free zones (PFZs) adjacent to grain boundaries can help to relief of stress concentrations on grain boundary precipitates. However, if the zone is too ductile, it may create large strain concentrations in grain boundary and resulting in enhanced grain boundary shear which may again lead to premature failure.  Srivastava et al. [114] observed cracks and voids formed throughout the specimen and particularly in the precipitate free zone during creep testing of a Ni-based single-crystal superalloy PWA1484.
6.5 Conclusions
            This chapter studied creep failure samples of DAFA29 creep tested in two different conditions.  The fracture surfaces and crack surfaces were characterized using a SEM. It is found that:
1.	Though the Laves and B2-NiAl phase precipitated along the boundaries can improve the creep properties, cracks were still initiated and propagated along the boundaries, which suggests that the boundaries are the weaker regions for causing fracture of the DAFA29 during creep.
2.	A PFZ is observed beside the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates along grain boundaries in the DAFA29 alloy. The PFZ is the weak region when stress applied at elevated temperature and it could potentially provide the path for propagation of cracks.
3.	No cracks were formed on precipitates in the f.c.c. matrix. 


Chapter 7 Conclusions and suggestions for Future Work


7.1	Conclusions
            A solutionizing anneal at 1200ºC followed by cold rolling and annealing at 800ºC can be used to generate a finer-scale and more uniform distribution of Laves phase precipitates in as-received DAFA29 alloy.  However, the solution anneal produced a large increase in grain size from 40 to 250 μm. Heat treated DAFA29 alloys contain Fe2Nb Laves phase, MC carbide, Ni3Al(Ti) L12, and B2 NiAl precipitates after the two thermo-mechanical treatments. During the thermo-mechanical processing, cold rolling produces a high density of dislocations, which act as nucleation sites for Fe2Nb Laves phase, MC carbide, B2 NiAl, and Ni3Al(Ti)  precipitate formation. Meanwhile, nanocrystalline grains were produced after cold rolling and short time anneals, which grow rapidly to micron-scale size on subsequent annealing at 800ºC.  These nanocrystalline steels processed through large strain cold rolling (90 %) exhibit a dramatic increase in yield strength up to 1280 MPa.  The yield strength decreases upon further annealing due to grain growth and precipitate coarsening. The yield strength of thermo-mechanically treated AFA steels exhibits a Hall-Petch relationship with a large value for σ0 that likely arises from precipitate strengthening (σppt) according to analytical simulation.
          Unfortunately, the TMT didn’t increase the yield strengths of AFA alloys at 700ºC, although it significantly enhanced the yield strength of AFA alloys at room temperature. The yield stress of TMT alloys decrease rapidly from 600ºC to 700ºC, which might be because loss of grain boundary strengthening in TMT alloys due to fast dislocation climb at 700ºC. At this temperature, dislocation will be able to move around obstacles easily and the large volume of grain boundaries in TMT alloys work as sites of weakness. The TMT alloys have higher strain rate sensitivity and lower activation volume compared to as-received DAFA29 at elevated temperatures. The higher strain rate sensitivity and lower activation volume are due to the nanocrystalline grain size of the alloys. The strain rate and stress of these TMT alloys satisfy a power law relationship with the stress exponent around 5, whereas the stress exponent is around 4 for the as-received DAFA29. These values ruled out the mechanisms of bulk diffusion and grain boundary diffusion to explain the flow behavior. At 700ºC, dislocation climb is the dominant mechanism for deformation of TMT alloys. When the temperature decreases to 600ºC, the mechanism might change to dislocation shearing indicated by the dramatically increased threshold stress. The flow stress of the as-received AFA alloy is insensitive to strain rate at 600ºC due to strong work hardening at this temperature. It also shows significant serrated flow on the stress strain curve, which might be associated with dynamic strain aging effect.
            After the characterization of aged AFA alloys, we found that the largest strengthening effect from L12 precipitates can be obtained by aging less than 24 h for both AFA alloys. During aging, the coarsening behavior of L12 precipitates was the same in both DAFA26 and DAFA29, i.e.: the addition of carbon and boron has no significant effects on the lattice parameter, morphology and size of L12 precipitates in the aged AFA alloys. Boron enhanced the grain boundary precipitates coverage and suppressed the coarsening of both Laves phase and B2-NiAl in the grain boundaries in AFA alloys. Boron addition in AFA alloys seems suppressed the formation of twins and discontinuous precipitation. This is mainly due to the impurities impede the migration of grain boundary. The yield strength of both DAFA26 and DAFA29 decreased as aging time increased. The strength loss is mainly due to the coarsening of L12 precipitates. The higher ductility 240h-aged DAFA29 is attributing to the boron addition. The boron increase grain boundary strength and optimize grain boundary precipitates distribution in grain boundaries. 
             Though the Laves and B2-NiAl phase precipitated along the boundaries can improve the creep properties, the cracks were still initiated and propagated along the boundaries, which suggests that the boundaries are the weaker regions for causing fracture of the DAFA29 during creep. The wide PFZ is observed beside the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates along grain boundaries in the DAFA29 alloy. It is the weak region when stress applied at elevated temperature and it could potentially provides the path for propagation of cracks. 
7.2 Suggestions for Future Work
7.2.1 The Boron Influence on AFA Alloys
            Although we studied the boron effect on the aged DAFA29 alloys and obtained some preliminary results, the detail effects of boron on the grain boundary is still not understand.  Why small amount of boron addition increases the creep life time significantly in AFA is not clear. In the grain boundary, where the boron is located and what functions it taken into Laves phase, B2-NiAl precipitates or PFZ region need further study. 
            Further experiments of studying segregation behavior of boron on grain boundaries in AFA alloys using EPMA and APT are suggested. 
7.2.2 Creep Tests of TMT alloys
            We performed tensile tests and strain rate jump tests at elevated temperature ranging from 600°C to 800°C.  All TMT alloys show higher yield strengths at room temperature and 600°C.  As the temperature increased to 700°C, all TMT alloys have lower yield strengths than 700°C.  However, the mechanisms of creep tests are different from tensile tests which are normally performed in a very short time. During the creep process, the creep stress may have influence on precipitates compared to the materials that were simply annealed. 
              In order to study the creep performances of all TMT alloys, creep to fracture experiments are suggested for future study.  The deformation mechanisms of AFA alloys and TMT alloys are concluded as dislocation climb mechanism which has no relationship with grain size. Diffusion creep is a function of grain size because grain size influence grain boundary diffusion.  Performing creep tests of TMT alloys will determine the fine grain size influence on the creep performance of AFA alloys.

In order to achieve energy conversion efficiencies of&gt;50 pct for steam turbines/boilers in power generation systems, materials are required that are both strong and corrosion-resistant at &gt;973 K (700 °C), and economically viable. Austenitic steels strengthened with Laves phase, NiAl and Ni3Al precipitates, and alloyed with aluminum to improve oxidation resistance, are potential candidate materials for these applications. The microstructure and microchemistry of recently developed alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Different thermo-mechanical treatments were performed on these steels to improve their mechanical performance. These reduced the grain size significantly to the nanoscale (~100 nm) and the room temperature yield strength to above 1000 MPa. A solutionizing anneal at 1473 K (1200 °C) was found to be effective for uniformly redistributing the Laves phase precipitates that form upon casting.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼I. INTRODUCTION
THE energy efficiency of fossil fuel-fired boiler/steam turbine power plants is strongly dependent on the operating temperature and pressure. Hence, it is benefi- cial to run such power plants at higher temperatures and pressures to enhance efficiency and reduce CO2 emis- sions. A key aspect for achieving this goal is the materials that are used for construction of the boilers and steam turbines.[1–3] Thus, extensive efforts are underway to develop affordable materials with the necessary strength, oxidation resistance, and corrosion resistance for oper- ation at temperature greater than 973 K (700 °C).[4–6] High-nickel alloys and nickel-based superalloys meet all the performance goals, but are too expensive.[7–9]
Face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) austenitic stainless steels are potential materials for this high temperature appli- cation. They have a combination of good high-temper- ature creep strength and oxidation resistance with a relatively low cost.[3,10] To that end, a family of inexpensive, high creep strength, alumina-forming aus- tenitic (AFA) stainless steels has recently been devel- oped.[3,11–21] The development is based on the discovery

that a protective alumina scale can be formed at 923 K
to 1073 K (650 °C to 800 °C) with 2.5 wt pct
Al.[3,13,16,22] The best materials recently developed have
creep rupture lifetimes &gt;3000 hours at 1023 K (750 °C)
and 100 MPa, nearly 20 times longer than commercially
available Fe-based Superalloy A286 (Fe-14.5Cr-25Ni-
2.1Ti-0.15Al). They also show much better oxidation
resistance compared to chromia-forming A286 at
1073 K (800 °C) in air containing 10 pct water vapor.[20]
These recently developed alloys are based on Fe-14Cr-
32Ni-3Nb-3Al-2Ti (wt pct) with various minor, but
important, elemental additions. The addition of Nb is

of Ni3(Al, Ti) phase in AFA alloys.[20]
In addition to Fe2Nb Laves phase and L12 (ordered f.c.c.) Ni3Al-type phase precipitates, a B2 (ordered b.c.c.) NiAl phase and MC carbides are observed in these AFA stainless steels.[22] The volume fractions of these phases depend on the alloy composition, mainly the Al and Nb contents. The addition of Nb is necessary to enhance the stability of the alumina scale formed at high temperature, and results in the formation of the C14 Fe2Nb Laves phase.[3,13,16,20] The Fe2Nb precipi- tates, which are stable up to 1900 K (1627 °C), are expected to be in equilibrium with both NbC and the f.c.c. iron matrix.[12,15] After an aging treatment at 1023 K (750 °C), NiAl type B2 phase precipitates can also be observed, although these have been reported to be ineffective for improving the yield strength of austenitic stainless steels above 673 K (400 °C).[5,18] However, they may enhance the creep resistance by affecting dislocation climb. Creep testing at 1023 K (750 °C) results in a finer and denser distribution of
￼￼
these secondary precipitates than in alloys that have simply been aged at the same temperature. Such fine- scale second-phase precipitates may be effective in further increasing the creep strength.[22] The NiAl B2 phase precipitates also play an important role in the oxidation resistance since they act as an Al reservoir for forming an alumina scale at high temperatures.[23]
As both Fe2Nb and NiAl precipitates demonstrate limited effects on the high-temperature strength at or above 923 K (650 °C),[20] the development of the AFA stainless steels has focused on introducing fine coherent precipitates such as L12-type precipitates.[20,22] Coherent Ni3Al precipitates are effective for improving the high- temperature mechanical properties in various nickel- and iron-based superalloys. One example is the iron- based superalloy A286, which shows good creep prop- erties due to the formation of coherent L12 Ni3Ti precipitates at ~1003 K (730 °C). However, the strengthening effect of Ni3Ti is limited because it is metastable at higher temperatures.[24,25] Coherent Ni3Al precipitates in AFA stainless steels[14] have been opti- mized to maximize their stability to improve creep performance.[20]
Cold work with 10 pct thickness reduction can also be effective for improving the creep properties of these AFA stainless steels[22,26–28] with the dislocations intro- duced during cold rolling acting as nucleation sites for MC (NbC) carbide precipitates, resulting in doubled creep lives at 1023 K (750 °C).[12,15]
The current study investigated the effect of severe cold work with 90 pct thickness reduction on the microstruc- ture and mechanical properties of recently developed AFA stainless steels, specifically the Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb- 3Al-2Ti wt pct-based AFA alloys. Detailed microstruc- tural analysis was performed on the samples before and after thermo-mechanical treatments.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
The AFA stainless steels used in this study were obtained from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Ingots of the alloys had been hot-rolled at 1373 K (1100 °C) (80 pct thickness reduction with ~15 to 20 pct thickness reduction per pass) and then annealed at 1373 K (1100 °C) for 30 minutes in Ar +
4 pct H2 gas, followed by air-cooling. The nominal and analyzed chemistry of the AFA stainless steel, referred to as DAFA29, are given in Table I. The chemical composition of these two alloys was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and gas com- bustion techniques at ORNL.[29]
The microstructures of the specimens before and after thermo-mechanical processing were examined by scan-
ning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD).
For examination in the SEM, samples were polished using increasingly fine grades of silicon carbide papers and then further polished using 0.3 lm alumina powders to obtain a mirror finish. The polished samples were etched using 4 pct nitric acid for 5 seconds followed by rinsing in water. The specimens were then examined in an FEI XL-30 field emission gun (FEG) SEM operated at 15 keV.
Thin foils for TEM examination were produced from 3-mm dia., 200-lm-thick disks by twin-jet electropol- ishing at 11 V and ~200 mA in a solution of 25 pct nitric acid in methanol at 253 K ( 20 °C) using a Struers Tenupol 5. The resulting thin foils were examined with an FEI Tecnai F20 FEG TEM operated at 200 kV and equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).
Thin foil specimens were polished from 200 lm thick disks to a thickness of 20 lm for synchrotron XRD measurements. The XRD experiments were performed at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory, with the X-ray microdiffraction facility at undulator beamline 2-ID-D.[30] X-ray photons with energy of 18 keV (wavelength = 0.688 nm) were selected using a Si h111i double-crystal monochromator, and then focused to a circular spot of ~400 nm through a Fresnel zone plate. The diffraction signals were collected with a Rayonix Mar165 CCD detector, with 2048 9 2048 pixels and 80 micron pixel size, located ~58 mm downstream of the sample. The total counting time was 55 seconds. Over this counting period, the sample was continuously rotated around an axis per- pendicular to the incident beam by 110 deg.
Two thermo-mechanical treatments of the AFA stainless steel DAFA29 were performed. A detailed flowchart of these two thermo-mechanical treatments is shown in Figure 1. In Method #1, DAFA29 was cold rolled to a 90 pct reduction in thickness with a ~4.5 pct reduction per pass and then heat-thermal treated at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4, 24, or 240 hours. In Method #2, the alloy is given a solutionizing anneal at 1473 K (1200 °C) and then cold rolled to a 90 pct reduction in thickness with a ~4.5 pct reduction per pass before annealing at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4, 24, or 240 hours.
After thermo-mechanical processing, room tempera- ture tensile tests were performed with a Hydraulic MTS testing machine. A preload force of 100 N was applied before the tensile tests were started. The initial strain rate for all tensile tests was 5 9 10 4 s 1. The tensile test specimens are dog-bone geometry with a gage length of 10 mm. They were polished using 800 grit silicon carbide papers and finished with 0.3 lm alumina powders to a

mirror finish. The elongations were measured directly from the specimens after the tensile tests.
In order to compare the simple annealed samples (without cold rolling) to thermo-mechanical-treated DAFA29, another two group of DAFA29 alloys were annealed as control samples. The first group (Method #1 control) samples were annealed at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4, 24, or 240 hours. The second group (Method #2 control) samples were annealed at 1473 K (1200 °C) and then post annealed at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4, 24, or 240 hours. The room temperature tensile tests of these two groups of control samples were also performed under the same test conditions.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. As-received Microstructures
A backscattered electron (BSE) image of the as- received DAFA29 showing the grain structure and the precipitates is shown in Figure 2(a). EDS data acquired
from the precipitates and the matrix are shown in Figures 2(b) and (c), respectively. The white precipitates are niobium enriched consistent with a Fe2Nb Laves phase. The Laves phase precipitates are aligned along the rolling direction, as shown in Figure 2(a) (white arrow). They are observed both on the grain boundary as well as in the interior of the grains. The size of these Laves phase is in the range 0.5 to 10 lm. Previous research suggested that the strengthening effect of Laves phase strongly depends on its size and distribution.[14] It has been predicted that better creep resistance could be obtained with further refinement and stabilization of the Fe2Nb particle sizes to ~100 nm.[14] MC carbides (M: Nb, Ti) are also observed in DAFA29. These precipi- tates are randomly distributed in the matrix with a size of ~5 lm. They normally have a blocky morphology. The predicted volume fraction of this phase is around 1 pct based on JMatPro simulation.
A bright field (BF) TEM image of a precipitate in DAFA29 located on the edge of a thin foil is shown in Figure 3(a). A selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern taken from the f.c.c. matrix (lower circle in Figure 3(a)) is shown in Figure 3(b). The diffraction pattern consists of two sets of different diffraction spots, which are superimposed diffraction patterns from the L12 phase and the f.c.c. matrix. The weak diffraction spots are superlattice reflections from the L12 phase, whereas the strong diffraction spots are from both the fundamental reflections from an L12 phase and the f.c.c. matrix. The orientation relationship between the L12 phase and the f.c.c. matrix is cube-on-cube. The superlattice reflection is similar to the diffraction spots observed in previous studies on similar alloys strengthened by nanoscale coherent L12-ordered intermetallic c¢-Ni3(Al, Ti) pre- cipitates.[20] A convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) pattern from the large precipitate viewed along [0001] (after tilting) is shown in Figure 3(c). It shows a hexagonal pattern. Based on this result and previous

EDS results (Figure 2(b)), it is confirmed that this precipitate is the Fe2Nb Laves phase.
B. Microstructures of Thermo-mechanically Processed DAFA29
In order to produce fine and uniformly distributed Laves phase precipitates, two thermo-mechanical treat- ments were used to process DAFA29, as shown in Figure 1. Previous research reported that cold rolling (with 10 pct thickness reduction) of precipitate-strength- ened austenitic stainless steels could improve creep properties, because the dislocations introduced by cold rolling acted as nucleation sites for fine MC (NbC)
carbide precipitates, resulting in enhanced creep resis- tance.[12,27,28] It should be noted that the alloys exam- ined here (DAFA29) can be cold rolled to more than 90 pct thickness reduction, indicating that the coarse second-phase precipitates do not degrade room temper- ature workability of the AFA alloys, similar to the results previously reported in Reference 22.
BSE images of DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1 are shown in Figure 4. The steel was cold rolled to a 90 pct reduction in thickness, after which it is evident that the large Laves phase precipitates had fractured (Figure 4(b), inset). These samples were then annealed at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4 hours (Figure 4(c)), 24 hours (Figure 4(d)), or 240 hours
METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A
￼Fig. 5—BSE images of DAFA29: (a) as received, (b) after a solutionizing anneal of 50 h at 1473 K (1200 °C), (c) after a subsequent 90 pct cold rolling reduction, and (c) after solutionizing, cold rolling, and annealing at 1073 K (800 °C) for (d) 2.4 h, (e) 24 h, or (f) 240 h.
(Figure 4(e)). The cold rolling fractured many of the Laves phase precipitates in the matrix resulting in smaller precipitates (Figures 4(c) through (e)).
BSE images of DAFA 29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #2 are shown in Figure 5. The aim of using this method is to solutionize the large Laves phase precipitates before cold rolling. Unfortunately, the large Laves phase precipitates could not be completely solu- tionized at 1473 K (1200 °C), although annealing sig- nificantly reduced their volume fraction (compare Figures 5(a) and (b)). The solutionizing anneal also produced a substantial increase in the average grain size from 40 to 250 lm (grain size was measured using the linear line intercept method). As observed for thermo- mechanical treatment Method #1, the residual large Laves phase precipitates also fractured during cold rolling. Upon subsequent annealing, the size of the residual Laves phase precipitates did not change signif- icantly. After the 240 hour anneal, fine-scale particles precipitated out and were evenly distributed in the matrix (Figure 5(f)). These new precipitates presumably nucleated on the dislocations generated during the 90 pct cold rolling. The inset in Figure 5(f) clearly shows precipitates with two different types of brighter contrast, white and light gray, likely due to the presence of two different phase compositions. The light gray phase is likely the Laves phase and the dark gray phase is likely B2 NiAl. These small precipitates were also observed in previous research on AFA alloys.[12,15]
Table II shows the average size of the Laves phase precipitates after both thermo-mechanical treatments using the particle size image analysis technique used by Trotter et al.[21] The sizes of the Laves phase precipitates are in the range of 167 to 562 nm, i.e., much smaller than the large Laves phase precipitates in Figures 2 and 3 which are 0.5 to 10 lm. As the annealing time increases from 2.4 to 240 hours, the size of the Laves phase increases from 167 to 417 nm for the samples

treated by Method #1. The size of the Laves phase in materials treated with Method #2 is slightly larger than those treated by Method #1 for all annealing times. This is due to the extra step of solutionizing in Method #2.
Comparing Figures 4 and 5, the BSE images of the samples after the solutionizing anneal show less Laves phase precipitates. This is especially clear in Figure 5(f), where the large Laves phase precipitates are barely observed. Instead, the small precipitates are uniformly distributed in the matrix. The solutionizing anneal used in Method #2 is an effective way to reduce the size and redistribute the Laves phase precipitates, resulting in a finer and denser distribution. Most of the small Laves phase precipitates appeared to be coupled with B2 NiAl precipitates. Figure 6 shows a BSE image of the precipitates. Based on EDS results, the brighter contrast precipitates are either Laves phase or MC carbides and the darker contrast precipitates are B2 NiAl precipitates. The B2 NiAl normally co-precipitates with the Laves phase during the thermo-mechanical treatment process. Such finer and denser distributed Laves phase and B2 NiAl precipitates (size are less than 1 lm) may be effective in further increasing the creep strength.[22]
BF TEM images and SAD patterns of DAFA 29 after cold rolling and annealing at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4, 24, or 240 hour (Method #1) are shown in Figure 7. After the 2.4 hours anneal many small grains with an

average grain size of ~100 nm are present. The SAD pattern shows diffraction rings (Figure 7(d)), a feature characteristic of fine-scale f.c.c. grains having many different orientations. As the annealing time is increased from 2.4 to 240 hours, the grain size increased from ~100 nm to ~1 lm. The diffraction patterns changed accordingly as the number of grains captured within the SAD aperture decreased resulting in a single crystal diffraction pattern from a single grain.
In conventional steels, elongated grains and/or aligned second-phase particles parallel to the rolling direction are developed after large strain cold roll- ing.[31,32] For the AFA steels, no elongated grains are observed. Instead, a large number of irregular nanoscale grains are observed in TEM images of the 90 pct cold rolled material after 2.4 hours annealing, indicating that all the grains are fully recrystallized after the 2.4 hours annealing process.

BF TEM images and SAD patterns of DAFA29 after a solutionizing anneal at 1473 K (1200 °C), cold rolling, and then annealing at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4, 24, or 240 hours (Method #2) are shown in Figure 8. For the sample annealed for 2.4 hours, many small grains are observed with an average grain size of ~200 nm with the SAD pattern exhibiting diffraction rings (Figure 8(d)). This is similar to 2.4 hour samples after thermo-me- chanical treatment Method #1, where fine grains (~200 nm) are produced by cold rolling and annealing for 2.4 hours. As the annealing time increases from 2.4 to 240 hours, the grain size increases from ~200 nm to ~2 lm.
Comparing Figures 7 and 8, the average grain size produced by Method #2 is ~2 times larger than the grain size produced by Method #1, which is due to grain growth during the solutionizing anneal process. This annealing step increases the average grain size of DAFA29 from 40 to 250 lm.
After thermo-mechanical treatment, the multiple second-phase precipitates in treated DAFA29 were studied by TEM/EDS/CBED.
A BF TEM image and EDS spectrum from a Laves phase precipitate in DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1 annealed for 240 hours are shown in Figure 9. The Laves phase precipitates appear darker than the matrix in the TEM image due to their greater thickness and/or compositional difference (heavy ele- ment Nb), and, hence, greater absorption. The inset in Figure 9(a) shows a CBED pattern from the circled region. The diffraction pattern indicates a hexagonal
crystal structure aligned at [0001]. EDS results from the same region of the Laves phase precipitate, Figure 9(b), indicate that it is enriched in Nb and Fe. The EDS data shows an atomic ratio of Fe to Nb of approximately 2:1, consistent with Fe2Nb precipitates, although the pre- cipitates also contain some other elements.
The creep resistance of the alloys strengthened by Fe2Nb Laves phase particles alone was previously found to be relatively low at 1023 K (750 °C) and 100 MPa in air, which was attributed to the relatively coarse size of the Fe2Nb precipitates.[12] Both large size and small size Fe2Nb precipitates can be observed in DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1, as shown in Figure 9. These newly formed small Laves phase pre- cipitates (~1 lm) might be helpful to enhance the creep performance.
A BF TEM image and EDS results from a NiAl precipitate in DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treat- ment Method #1 and annealed for 240 hours are shown in Figure 10. The CBED pattern in Figure 10(b) inset corresponds to a B2 structure viewed along the [211] zone axis. EDS analysis results from the circled region of the NiAl precipitate are shown in Figure10(b). Although the precipitates are mostly Ni and Al, they also contain other elements. The NiAl precipitates are observed after both thermo-mechanical treatments. They are not present in the as-received DAFA29. A previous study suggested this B2 phase is likely to increase the creep resistance by affecting dislocation climb in the f.c.c. matrix due to their resistance to dislocation cutting during creep deformation.[15,22]

The B2 phase precipitates also play an important role for the oxidation resistance of the alloy and work as Al reservoirs, which provide Al to maintain the protective alumina scale on the material’s surface at high temper- ature.[22]
A BF TEM image and EDS results from a Ni3Al precipitate on the edge of a thin foil from DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1 and annealed 240 hours are shown in Figure 11. The Ni3Al precipi- tates are spherical with a diameter less than 100 nm. The inset in Figure 11(a) shows a CBED pattern from the circled region of the Ni3Al precipitate. This corresponds to a pattern from an L12 structure viewed along the [212] zone axis. EDS data acquired from the region circled in the TEM image of this precipitate is shown in
Figure 11(b). The atomic ratio of Ni to Al(Ti) is approximately 3:1, with small amounts of other ele- ments present.
The average size of the L12 precipitates in this heat- treated alloy is ~84 nm, which is about eight times larger than in the as-received alloy. These L12 precipitates have a similar size to the Ni3Al observed in the AFA alloy after creep tests of 3008 hours at 1023 K (750 °C) and 100 MPa.[20] Besides the spherical L12 precipitates, no other nanoscale particles, such as carbides or borides, are observed after the thermo-mechanical treatments.
MC carbide (M: Nb, Ti) precipitates are also observed in DAFA29 both before and after thermo-mechanical treatments. Figure 12(a) shows a secondary electron image of MC carbides in one thermo-mechanically

treated DAFA29 sample. The upper inset in Figure 12(b) is an EBSD pattern, indicating that this is the [011] zone axis of a MC precipitate. Both the pattern and EDS results show this is a MC precipitate.
Since the lattice parameters of the f.c.c. matrix and L12 precipitates are similar, synchrotron XRD was used to determine their respective lattice parameters in the alloy. Synchrotron XRD results from the DAFA29 samples after a 1473 K (1200 °C) solutionizing anneal for 50 hours, 90 pct cold rolling, and then a 1073 K (800 °C) anneal for 240 hour, are shown in Figure 13. The 240 hour annealed samples were selected for this measurement because the size of precipitates is larger due to particle coarsening, and hence, the XRD signal will be stronger than in the 24 or 2.4 hours annealed samples. In the XRD pattern, the Miller indices of the f.c.c. peaks are labeled in blue, the L12 superlattice peaks are labeled in red, the Laves phase peaks are labeled in black, and B2 peaks are labeled in green.
The lattice parameters for each phase were calculated based on the highest angle peaks of each phase. The calculated lattice parameters for the phases in the 240 hour annealed sample were 3.609 A ̊ for the L12 phase, 3.599 A ̊ for the f.c.c. matrix, and 2.892 A ̊ for the NiAl phase. The lattice misfit between the L12 precipitates and the f.c.c. matrix was only 0.28 pct after the 240 hour heat treatment, indicating that very small elastic strain between the precipitates and the f.c.c. matrix is devel- oped.
The room temperature tensile test results for DAFA29 after the two different thermo-mechanical treatments are shown in Figure 14. The samples in Figure 14(a) were cold rolled and then annealed at 1073 K (800 °C) for different time. The yield strength and plastic strain to failure of the as-received DAFA29
are 560 MPa and 22 pct, respectively. The yield strength increased to 1280 MPa and the plastic strain decreased to 5.1 pct after cold rolling and a 2.4 hour anneal. The yield strength decreased with further annealing; the yield strength of the sample after a 24 hour anneal was 1070 MPa, and was reduced to 800 MPa when the sample was annealed for 240 hours. Surprisingly, the strain to failure for all the cold rolled and annealed samples did not change significantly as the annealing time increased and the yield strength decreased.
The samples shown in Figure 14(b) were treated with the additional step of a solutionizing anneal before cold rolling. Again, the yield strength increased to 1150 MPa and the plastic strain decreased to 6.2 pct after this treatment followed by a 2.4 hour anneal. The yield strength decreased to 1020 MPa for an increase in the annealing time to 24 hours, and was further reduced to 750 MPa after an anneal for 240 hours. Again, the strain to failure for the samples treated by this method did not change significantly after cold rolling and different annealing time.
The room temperature yield strengths of these treated DAFA29 specimens are four times higher than previous solution heat-treated AFA alloys and two times higher than the aged AFA alloys studied in Reference 22. This difference is mainly due to the nm-scale or lm-scale grains generated after either thermo-mechanical treat- ment. Comparison between Figures 14(a) and (b) reveals that the solutionizing anneal is not effective in enhancing the tensile strength of DAFA29, although it is helpful to reduce the size of Laves phase and produce a finer and denser distribution of the Laves phase precipitates.

cold work) are shown in Figure 14(c). Simply, the control samples are annealed at 1073 K (800 °C) for different periods without any cold work. The yield strength increased to 747 MPa from 560 MPa and the plastic strain decreased slightly to 20 pct after a 2.4 hour anneal. The yield strength further increased to 890 MPa and the plastic strain decreased to 10 pct after a 24 hour anneal. For a 240 hour annealing time, the yield strength decreased to 760 MPa, while the plastic strain still continued to decrease to 8 pct.
For comparison, the tensile test results for DAFA29 control samples after using the thermal treatment (Method #2 without cold work) are shown in Figure 14(d). Basically, the control samples are solutionizing anneal at 1473 K (1200 °C) followed by a anneal at 1073 K (800 °C) for different periods without any cold work. The results show that all the samples after this two-step annealing process are brittle and exhibit no plastic
strain. The yield strength is slightly higher than that of the as-hot-rolled DAFA29 of 560 MPa.
In order to better understand the correlation between the grain size and the room-temperature mechanical properties obtained, the Hall–Petch relation for the DAFA29 alloys was determined. The yield strength of the thermo-mechanically treated steel obeys a Hall– Petch relationship between the yield strength r0.2 and the grain size D, i.e.,: ry = r0 + KD 0.5, where r0 = 600 MPa and K = 230 MPa lm 0.5 according to the linear fit to the yield strength vs D 0.5. The value of r0 differs considerably from that obtained in a 63 pct cold-rolled AISI 301 austenitic stainless steel[33] of 252 MPa (the value of K was 270 MPa lm 0.5, similar to this work).
The stress r0 can be described, in general, as the sum of several strengthening mechanisms: (1) precipitate strengthening (rppt), (2) strain hardening (rd), and (3)

solid solution strengthening (rss).[33] The off-set stress can be expressed as
r0 1⁄4 rppt þ rd þ rss: 1⁄21 
The large r0 observed in the current work likely arises from substantial precipitate strengthening from the fi- nely spaced L12 Ni3Al precipitates. The estimated rppt is ~289 MPa according to the Eq. [2] and [3] (based on the Orowan looping mechanism) in Reference 34

where G is the shear modulus, b is the burgers vector, d is the particle diameter, and L is the particle spacing. For this calculation, a shear modulus of 80,000 MPa and a burgers vector of 2.5 9 10 4 lm were used. The particle diameter used for the calculation is 84 nm.

where f is the precipitate volume fraction. The volume fraction of L12 Ni3Al precipitates is 21 pct.[20] Accord- ing to this calculation, the precipitate strengthening rppt contributes almost half of the value of the off-set stress r0. Note the value of rppt is variable and depends on the precipitates size and dislocation-precipitate interaction mechanism.
BSE images of the cross-sections of the strained microstructure for DAFA29 after treatment with Method #1, Method #2, Method #1 without cold rolling, and Method #2 without cold rolling are shown in Figures 15(a) through (d), respectively. Figures 15(e) through (h) are the corresponding BSE images of the fracture surface of those four samples. In the sample treated with Method #1 the large Laves phase fractured perpendicular to the applied stress direction (Figure 15(a)). The fracture surface shows small dimples with Laves
and/or B2 phase in the dimple center (Figure 15(e)). Large Laves phase and MC carbide are also observed on fracture surface in this sample. In the sample treated with Method #2 (Figures 15(b) and (f)), the fracture surface shows small dimples similar to Figure 15(e) with size of 1 to 2 lm. In the sample treated with Method #1 without cold rolling (Figures 15(c) and (g)), grain boundary precipitates are generated after annealing for 240 hours. Larger cracks are observed along the grain boundaries. The fracture surface indicates the failures are both on grain boundaries and in the matrix. Both fine grain boundary precipitates and large dimples are observed. For the sample treated with Method #2 without cold rolling (Figures 15(d) and (h)), Laves phase precipitates (exhibiting bright contrast) are pre- sent on the grain boundaries and triple junctions (Figure 15(d)). The fracture surface of the materials after the 240 hour anneal, shown in Figure 15(h), show intergranular fracture. This fracture mode of the mate- rial is different from the others since the grain bound- aries were fully covered by Laves phase and NiAl precipitates. The elongation of this sample is less than 1 pct as shown in Figure 14(d).
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Microstructural analysis and mechanical testing of the recently developed AFA stainless steel alloy DAFA29 have been performed in both the as-received condition and after two series of thermo-mechanical treatments. During these treatments, materials were cold rolled to a 90 pct thickness reduction [both with and without a solutionizing anneal at 1473 K (1200 °C)] and then heat treated at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4, 24, or 240 hours.
It was found that
1. A solutionizing anneal at 1473 K (1200 °C) fol- lowed by cold rolling and annealing at 1073 K

(800 °C) can be used to generate a finer-scale and more uniform distribution of Laves phase precipi- tates.
2. The solution anneal produces a large increase in grain size from 40 to 250 lm.
3. The alloy contain Fe2Nb Laves phase, MC carbide, Ni3Al(Ti) L12, and B2 NiAl precipitates after either thermo-mechanical treatment.
4. Cold rolling produces a high density of dislocations, which act as nucleation sites for Fe2Nb Laves phase, MC carbide, B2 NiAl, and Ni3Al(Ti) precipi- tate formation.
5. Nanocrystalline grains are produced after cold roll- ing and short-time anneals, which grow rapidly to lm-scale size on subsequent annealing at 1073 K (800 °C).
6. Nanocrystalline steels processed through large strain cold rolling exhibit a dramatic increase in yield strength up to 1280 MPa. The yield strength decreases upon further annealing due to grain growth and pre- cipitate coarsening.
7. The yield strength of thermo-mechanically treated AFA steels exhibits a Hall–Petch relationship with a large value for r0 that likely arises from precipi- tate strengthening (rppt).

1. Introduction
AFAs (alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels) are a new promising class of steels with potential for use in a number of energy-conversion applications [1e9]. For example, there is a cur- rent effort to develop power plant materials with excellent creep strength and corrosion resistance at temperatures &gt;760  C. Increasing the operating temperature improves efficiency with the added benefit of reducing CO2 emissions [10e13]. The relatively low cost of ferritic steels make them desirable candidates, but they have yet to show the creep strength and oxidation resistance needed at high temperatures. Nickel-based superalloys can be used at temperatures in excess of 760  C, but their high cost makes them less desirable for most applications [12,13]. In order for an AFA to be a viable alternative, it must have a strength and creep resistance that are close to or exceed those of Ni-based alloys. AFAs have relied on MC carbides for strength [1,3,4,14], but at temperatures greater than 800  C there is concern that the carbides formed could coarsen and dissolve [4].
Further refinement of the Fe2Nb Laves phase particles has po- tential to improve the creep life and high temperature strength of

abstract
The effects of cold work on the microstructural evolution during aging of a solutionized alumina-forming austenitic stainless steel, Fee20Cre30Nie2Nbe5Al (at.%), were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Cold work prior to aging at either 700  C or 800  C facilitated the heterogeneous precipitation of both Laves phase and B2-type NiAl precipitates. While often co-located after cold work, these particles were distinct. g0-Ni3Al precipitates were also observed in samples aged at 700  C with 90% prior cold work. Compared to material that had not been strained, defects introduced by 50 and 90% cold work at 700  C and 90% cold work at 800  C not only caused a more rapid precipitation in the matrix but also an increase in the total volume fraction of precipitates as compared to material that had been simply aged.

AFAs. Fe2Nb Laves phase particles have shown long-term stability at high temperatures [14e17]. However, previous studies that looked to Laves phase particles for strength have only seen low or mod- erate creep resistance [14,17]. Decreasing the precipitate size and increasing the volume fraction would enable the precipitates to effectively pin dislocations and extend creep life. A Laves phase dispersion with particles less than 100 nm in diameter is recom- mended to obtain creep-levels on-par with MC carbide strength- ened austenitic stainless steels [17].
One pathway to reducing the size and increasing the volume fraction of Laves phase precipitates in the matrix is to nucleate precipitates on dislocations. Nucleation on dislocations is an effect first modeled by Cahn [18] in 1957 and occurs because it lowers the total strain energy of an embryo. In order to effectively reduce the interfacial energy, precipitates that nucleate on dislocations should be well-matched on at least one matrix plane so they are able to form low-energy coherent or semi-coherent interfaces [19]. Images of Fe2Nb that has precipitated in austenite alloys that have the base components of AFAs (Fee20Cre35Nie2Nb and Fee20Cre25Nie 2Nb) [15] show strain contrast in TEM images that is indicative of a semi-coherent precipitate-matrix interface, making Fe2Nb a promising candidate for precipitation on dislocations in AFA-type alloys.
Prestraining via cold work introduces dislocations that could dramatically affect the precipitation of the Laves phase, similar to
￼￼￼
what has been observed in previous studies of other precipitate systems [20e23]. The effectiveness of prestraining before aging in changing microstructure and improving material properties de- pends on characteristics of the particular alloy system analyzed and the synergy of a number of different variables including, but not limited to: aging temperature, the amount of prestrain, and competing precipitation phenomena. For example, the improved hardness observed in a copper-bearing steel that had been pre- strained prior to aging at 300  C was attributed to additional par- ticle nucleation on dislocations or excess vacancies arising from prestraining, however at an aging temperature of 500  C the pre- strain had little effect on hardness or particle nucleation [21]. In aluminum alloys cold work has been shown to have different ef- fects depending on the alloy system, with dislocations enhancing hardening by providing nucleation sites for precipitates in the Ale Cu, AleCueMg, and AleCueLi systems, while not proving effective for hardening in other aluminum systems [24]. Severe plastic deformation by cold rolling at room temperature followed by subsequent aging has been shown to improve both strength and ductility in a high strength AleMgeSi alloy [23] as well as a CueAg alloy [22]. An increase in precipitation after cold work has been observed with other precipitates in alloys more closely related to AFAs. HTUPS (high-temperature ultrafine-precipitation- strengthened steel) alloys, modified for Al2O3 formation, are cold worked to enhance the precipitation of nanoscale MC carbide precipitates during creep [1,14,25]. While aging studies on AFA- type alloys have been done in the past [16], Laves phase pre- cipitates have yet to be targeted via a combined aging and cold working approach.
In this study, the effect of cold work on a solution-annealed AFA- type alloy, Fee20Cre30Nie2Nbe5Al (at.%) was investigated by comparing samples that had received cold work prior to aging to those that were simply aged. Microstructural analysis was per- formed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). In addition, the effect of cold work and aging on the hardness of the material was examined.
2. Experimental
Fee20Cre30Nie2Nbe5Al (at.%) ingots were arc melted and drop cast into a copper mold 15.2 cm long 2.5 cm in diameter under argon. Common cast features [26] were observed: there was some segregation and a central pore was created during the so- lidification process. The as-cast material was homogenized in vac- uum for 24 h at 1250  C, then water-quenched. This solutionizing
treatment was used since SEM investigations confirmed that it enabled the formation of a solutionized single phase matrix.
Specimens were milled to 4 mm 4 mm w13 mm, and some were cold-rolled with approximately a 0.3 mm reduction per pass until the desired thickness reduction (50 or 90% ` 1%) was ach- ieved. Unrolled, 50% rolled, and 90% rolled samples were aged in air for24hand240hat700 C,andfor2.4,24,and240hat800 C.The resulting microstructures were examined using a FEI XL30 field emission gun (FEG) SEM operated at 15 kV and a FEI Tecnai F20ST FEG TEM operated at 200 kV, both equipped with EDS. For SEM examination samples were mechanically polished to a mirror finish using 0.05 mm alumina powder in a water suspension. TEM samples 3 mm in diameter and w100 mm thick were electrolytically thinned using a twin-jet electropolisher at about  20  C and 11V in a so- lution of 25% nitric acid in methanol. TEM specimens were exam- ined using a Phillips CM200 FEG STEM operated at 200 kV that allowed for elemental mapping via EDS. Vickers hardness testing was conducted using a Leitz MINIload tester under a load of 1.96 N (200 g) with a 15 s dwell time at room temperature. No less than 10 indents were made for each condition.
SEM images taken at 8000 were processed and analyzed using ImageJ [27]. BSE images were used for particle analysis since BSE atomic number contrast allowed for optimal differentiation and detection of the matrix, Laves phase, and NiAl precipitates. The image processing routine included contrast enhancement followed by thresholding to include bright or dark contrasted regions to delineate Laves or NiAl particles, respectively. Images were then despeckled and outlier filters were run and small artifacts removed in the final binarized image. The particle parameters calculated include area fraction and equivalent circle diameter given as 2(A/ p)1/2, of a circle with equivalent area A. SEM resolution limits and image quality was taken into account in order to minimize error. Segmented areas that had low pixel counts that corresponded to particles with a diameter smaller than 20e60 nm were excluded from the results.
3. Results

After the solution treatment the average grain size was 865 mm.

later) are C14-type Fe2Nb phase (Fig. 1(b)) and that the darker precipitates are B2-ordered NiAl (Fig. 1(c)). The presence of both Laves phase and NiAl precipitates is in agreement with previous TEM analysis on precipitates in this alloy [17] and is typical of AFA- type alloys [1e9].
After sufficient aging and/or prior cold work Laves phase and B2eNiAl precipitates often appear interconnected. For example, Fig. 2 shows a dark field STEM image and EDS elemental maps of a specimen reduced by 50% and then aged for 240 h at 800  C. The EDS maps and spectral data of Laves and B2-precipitates reveal that while the nickel makes up a large component of the matrix, it couples with the aluminum and is concentrated in the NiAl parti- cles. Compared to the Al-rich B2 precipitate, the Nb-rich Laves phase precipitate has a lower aluminum (1.5 at.% vs. 20.7 at.%) and nickel (18 at.% vs. 43.6 at.%) content, and a higher iron (40 at.% vs. 25.1 at.%), chromium (15.0 at.% vs. 10.2 at.%) and aluminum (25.5 at.% vs. 0.4 at.%) content. The EDS maps also reveal that while often co-located after cold work, the NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitates
are distinct. TEM investigation of specimens after 90% cold work followed by aging at 700  C show the presence of fine g0-Ni3Al (L12) precipitates (Fig. 3). These precipitates have been observed in creep rupture samples of this alloy at 750  C 100 MPa and were noted to improve creep resistance [17].
Microstructural changes are shown as a function of rolling reduction and annealing time after aging at 700  C in Fig. 4. When the Fee20Cre30Nie2Nbe5Al (at.%) alloy is as-aged at 700  C without prior cold work, no Laves phase precipitates were visible in the BSE images of the matrix up to 240 h (Fig. 4(a) and (d)). With cold work prior to aging at 700  C both the B2 and Laves phase particles are globular in shape and are almost always coupled together in the matrix (Fig. 4(b), (c), (e) and (f)). Specimens with 50% (Fig. 4(b)) and 90% (Fig. 4(c)) cold work prior to aging for 24 h at 700  C had a non-uniform, but fine distribution of Laves phase particles with slightly larger B2 particles in the matrix. A similar pattern of increased precipitation after cold work was observed after a 240 h anneal at 700  C (Fig. 4(d)e(f)).

Fig. 5 shows the microstructural evolution of the alloy at 800  C as a function of rolling reduction and annealing time. At 800  C the microstructural response to aging and cold work was markedly different to that at 700  C. NiAl and Laves phases precipitated at 800  C, but Ni3Al particles were not stable at this temperature. Unlike at 700  C, at 800  C with no cold work, precipitates are visible both in the matrix and on the grain boundaries after 2.4 h (Fig. 5(a)). The Laves phase precipitates are elongated. Precipitates
on the grain boundary are larger than those in the matrix and there are no NiAl precipitates visible in the matrix, but they are present on the grain boundary. After 24 h there is a significant increase in the size of the Laves phase precipitates in the matrix and some are coupled with the B2-ordered NiAl precipitates (Fig. 5(d)). The Laves phase precipitates are needle-like and have several preferred ori- entations in the matrix. After 240 h more NiAl particles are present. From Fig. 5(g) they do not appear to be homogeneously distributed

in the matrix, but are co-located with Laves phase precipitates similar to the observations at 700  C.
Faster precipitation kinetics after cold work were also observed at 800  C as compared to 700  C when holding the aging time constant at 2.4 h (Fig. 5(a)e(c))), 24 h (Fig. 5(d)e(f)), and 240 h (Fig. 5(f)e(i)). After 50% cold work Laves phase precipitates are present in the matrix and on the grain boundary (Fig. 5(b), (e) and (h)), displaying a preferred orientation relationship with the matrix as observed in the as-aged case. With 90% cold work (Fig. 5(f) and (i)) the microstructure more closely resembles that of the alloy with cold work at 700  C. The Laves phase no longer appears elongated, but is granular in shape without any obvious preferred growth direction. Also, in the samples aged at 800  C after 90% cold work on increasing the annealing time from 24 h to 240 h (Fig. 5(f) and (i)) it appears there is growth of both the Laves phase and B2 decorated subgrain boundaries. While Laves phase precipitation was the main target of this study, samples with 90% cold work highlight once again how cold work influenced the precipitation process so that Laves was concurrent with NiAl precipitation. For example, whereas it was noted that an aging treatment of 2.4 h at 800  C (Fig. 5(a)) did not show significant NiAl precipitation, the same heat treatment after a 90% rolling reduction showed the matrix inun- dated with both NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitates (Fig. 5(c)). Without cold work, the B2 NiAl precipitates were rarely observed in the matrix except for after long aging times (Fig. 5(g)).
In Fig. 6(a) the Vickers hardness of the solutionized alloy at 700  C (w160 HV) increased with subsequent aging for 24 h and 240 h (w300 and w367 HV respectively). 50 and 90% reductions prior to aging improved the hardness at each aging time by at least 90 HV compared to the as-aged state. Within the 240 h aging period, the alloy only shows a hardness peak ( w495 HV) after a 90% rolling reduction prior to aging for 24 h. Subsequent aging to 240 h saw a slight decrease to w471 HV. In a similar manner to the 700  C aged samples, aging at 800  C led to increased hardness after 50% and 90% rolling reductions prior to aging compared to the as- aged material at each time interval (Fig. 6(b)). However, for each reduction condition, there was an initial increase in hardness after 2.4 h and a subsequent decrease in hardness with further aging at 800  C. For example, samples without cold work and those with reductions of 0%, 50%, and 90% saw hardness drop between aging at 2.4hand24h.
4. Discussion
The above results show that cold rolling after solutionizing, but prior to aging, produces both more rapid precipitation of the Laves phase in the matrix and causes matrix precipitation of NiAl at 700  C and 800  C and of Ni3Al at 700  C. With aging, the Laves precipitates show a trend of initially fast growth followed by sub- sequent slower coarsening as observed in a 9CrW steel [28]. As

observed in the work of Yamamoto et al. after creep-rupture of this alloy at 750  C [17], when this alloy is simply aged at 800  C the Laves phase is also plate-like in shape. Samples that were simply aged without prior cold work show precipitation trends similar to those observed by Takeyama [15] of the precipitation of Laves phase on the grain boundary and within the grain for the alloy Fee20Cre 30Nie2Nb after aging. The generated TimeeTemperature-Precipi- tation (TTP) diagram showed that after aging for 1200 h at 800  C Laves phase particles also precipitated homogeneously in the ma- trix with grain boundary precipitates being larger than those in the matrix. After 24 h at 800  C the coarsening of the C14-type phase was mostly complete, except for where the C-14-type phase was
coupled with the NiAl-type B2 phase. The Fe2Nb and the NiAl phase has also shown thermal stability after 2160 h at 800  C in an Fee 20Cre15Nie5Al-base alloy [14] and at 2012 h in other AFA alloys [16]. The Laves phase precipitates consistently grew along only a few directions within a given grain.
Image analysis of particle size at 700  C (Figs. 7 and 8) and 800  C (Figs. 9 and 10) provides insight into how aging and cold work impacted NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitate growth. A lognormal distribution shows the best fit for most of the sample data. At 700  C cold work induced precipitate formation of the Laves (Fig. 7) and B2eNiAl (Fig. 8). These precipitates saw modest in- creases in size when aging from 24 to 240 h. This early precipitate

formation would not have occurred with aging alone except at higher temperatures. This is an effect that has been seen in alpha- iron, where cold work samples caused precipitation to occur at a much lower temperature (250  C) than in samples that had simply been aged (525  C) and was also attributed to lattice defects increasing the diffusion of the precipitate-forming element [29]. At 800  C with 0, 50% and 90% cold work both Laves and B2e NiAl precipitate sizes more than doubled when aging from 2.4 to 240 h (Figs. 9 and 10). The same was true for the NiAl except for the case of 90% cold work where the average particle size was relatively stable in going from 24 to 240 h. 50% cold work did not increase the volume fraction of precipitates compared to the as- annealed state, while 90% cold work led to a larger volume frac- tion of precipitates. In all cases, the standard deviation of the particle sizes increased with aging. TEM images of samples aged at the shorter 2.4 h interval showed very few particles existed below the data collection range used in the SEM so volume fraction re- sults are expected not to be significantly impacted by SEM reso- lution limits.
A refined matrix that had reduced precipitate size and increased volume fraction was the desired microstructure for improved creep strength. In all cases up to 240 h at 700  C Laves and NiAl particles did not show large increases in size and were w30e70 nm above the upper 100 nm size limit (Figs. 7 and 8). At 800  C while Laves
particles initially started out in the 100 nm range, they grew to over 250 nm after aging at 240 h (Fig. 9). NiAl particle size increased to over 300 nm with just aging and with 50% cold work. Particle size did not increase as rapidly in going from 24 h (181 nm) to 240 h (188 nm) after 90% cold work (Fig. 10). Even though particles over 100 nm were observed after 240 h, cold working the material did lead to a higher volume fraction of precipitates. Despite particle growth at 700  C and 800  C, for each aging condition samples with 90% cold work had the highest total volume fraction of Laves and NiAl precipitates (Table 1).
The faster precipitation kinetics observed in the austenitic alloy Fee20Cre30Nie2Nbe5Al after cold work is not unusual. For example, in as-cast FeNiMnAl alloys, b-Mn-structured particles only precipitate out after long anneals, but the high dislocation densities and large concentrations of vacancies in samples that have been mechanically milled accelerates their nucleation significantly [30]. Similarly, in 316 austenitic stainless steels, it was speculated that an acceleration of intermetallic precipitation could occur due to the speeding up of substitutional diffusion via an increased defect concentration. Laves-phase precipitation was accelerated after cold work and it was hypothesized that it was the result of increased diffusivity of elements that made up the Laves phase [20]. Takeyama’s analysis indicated that in Fee20Cre30Nie 2Nb the formation of the Laves phase was controlled by Nb

￼￼diffusion in the austenite [15] and it follows in this case that the introduction of cold work into the alloy increased the diffusivity of the Laves phase forming elements in the austenitic matrix. In general, the distribution of the particles after cold work was non- uniform. At both 700 and 800  C the alloy microstructure after cold work is not as homogeneous as for alloys that had simply been aged due to the presence of features such as deformation bands, cellular networks etc. The precipitation structure would most likely have been more uniform after deformation had par- ticles been present during the rolling reduction, but since the starting point was a fully-solutionized matrix, their distribution was affected by the dislocation structures that were introduced by cold work [31].
Both the Laves and NiAl phases are no longer elongated and are instead globular after 90% cold work followed by aging at 800  C. The globular precipitates observed after 50% cold work at 700  C and 90% cold work at 800  C appeared to have no preferred crys- tallographic orientation. A number of factors could have influenced this change in morphology. Their shape may have been influenced by their general appearance on grain boundaries and densely packed dislocations. Their concurrent precipitation also may have affected growth. When Takeyama compared Fee20Cre35Nie2Nb to Fee20Cre25Nie2Nb the Laves phase morphology was shown to change with the c/a ratio. It was also demonstrated that the alloy with decreased nickel content contained a Laves phase that was smaller and less elongated [15].
The hardness for the alloy aged at 700  C is reflective of changes brought about by aging and cold work (Fig. 6(a)). As Laves and NiAl particles form their constituent atoms contribute less to solution strengthening and more to precipitate strengthening. At 700  C after 50% cold work, hardness increases in conjunction with an increase in the volume fraction of both NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitates. With 90% cold work there is increased hardness as compared to 50% cold worked samples with a peak in hardness at 24 h, the decrease at 240 h is most likely influenced by particle growth. The presence of the Ni3Al particles most likely contributes to the higher hardness values seen at 700  C compared with those seen at 800  C. At 800  C a hardness peak is not only observed after a 90% reduction, but also with a 50% reduction and by simply aging. The higher temperature is most likely the reason behind the increased aging rate due to the aforementioned enhanced diffu- sion through the matrix. At 800  C with no cold work the single hardness peak is consistent with simple nucleation and precipitate growth. With the rise in the volume fraction of NiAl (0.3%e2.6%) the NiAl precipitates increase by nearly a third in size (194 vs. 322 nm), which may be the cause of the decrease in hardness (Fig. 6(b)). With 90% cold work, after aging at 800  C for 24 h a large hardness decrease is congruent with the growth of recrys- tallized grains (Fig. 5(c)). After 240 h (244 Hv), the recrystallization that has occurred at 800  C results in a hardness similar to the 240 h as-aged condition (242 HV).
5. Conclusions
Cold work resulted in the creation of a defect structure that facilitated the heterogeneous precipitation of both C14-type Fe2Nb- type and B2-type NiAl precipitates. Increasing the amount of cold work caused the B2 phase to precipitate out after shorter anneals and at a lower temperature. Both B2 and Laves phases experienced more rapid precipitation in the matrix compared to material that had not been strained prior to aging at 700  C and 800  C. g0-Ni3Al precipitates were also noted after a 90% rolling reduction prior to aging at 700  C. Rolling reductions of 50 and 90% followed by aging at 700  C and a 90% rolling reduction followed by aging at 800  C was shown to be effective in accelerating precipitation and refining the precipitates in Fee20Cre30Nie2Nbe5Al. At 700  C, cold work was effective in increasing precipitate volume fraction at each aging condition when compared to samples that were simply aged. The change in the kinetics occurring at the higher temperature of 800  C influenced the effects of aging and cold work. For example, hardness peaks were observed with and without cold work. Pre- cipitate size also generally increased. In the case of 90% cold work, the number density of precipitates only decreases with time even though the combined precipitate number density peaked and more than tripled within a short time period as compared to simply aged samples. Even when taking coarsening into consideration, with 90% cold work, the combined NiAl and Laves phase volume fraction increased. The increased precipitation caused by sufficient levels of cold work resulted in increased hardness when compared to ma- terial that had been simply aged.

Introduction
ENGINEERING design of equipment subjected to creep conditions is usually based on creep and creep-rupture re- sults obtained from constant-load tests. Therefore, a great deal of creep information is continually being obtained on commercial alloys under constant-load conditions. It is important, however, in studying basic aspects of creep to obtain results also under conditions of constant stress [1-6],1 During a creep test the cross-sectional area of the specimen decreases with increasing strain, and under a constant load the stress increases. Since creep rate is a function of the stress, it becomes difficult to analyze constanWoad results in terms of basic mechanisms of creep.
In the present paper, a compact, cam-lever type device for application of either constant stress or constant load in simple tension for large uniform deformations is described. The profile of the constant-stress cam lever is similar to that of the Andrade- Chalmers beam [2], which was defined from a graphical design. In the present case, exact parametric equations for the cam profile have been determined. For constant load, the device reduces to two rigidly attached wheels, one with a larger radius for load application and one with a smaller radius to transmit the load to the specimen.
Using this apparatus, a series of creep tests on a T y p e 316 austenitic stainless steel have been made under constant-stress conditions and the results of these tests are reported.
Design of Test Apparatus
Although this presentation deals primarily with constant-stress testing, a constant-load assembly is also described because it forms an integral part of the apparatus that was constructed.
The constant-load system is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The load to the specimen is transmitted through the smaller wheel of radius R, whereas the applied load W is transmitted through the large wheel of radius p. The mechanical advantage, therefore, is p/R.
To maintain a constant stress, a earn lever with a profile similar to the Andrade-Chalmers beam [2] has been designed by an analj'tieal method and is shown schematically in Fig. 2. Trans- mittal of forces is essential^' the same as for the constant-load

assembly. In the actual apparatus to be described later the constant-load wheel is rigidly attached to one side of the small wheel and the constant-stress cam is rigidly attached to the opposite side. Thus, for either constant load or constant stress, the load to the specimen is applied through the same wheel of radius R. For the constant-stress case the initial mechanical ad- vantage is r0/R, but diminishes as the specimen elongates.
In order to maintain a constant stress, the load P on the speci- men must be reduced as the specimen elongates to compensate for the reduction in area A. Thus the instantaneous stress P/A must remain constant. By assuming constancy of volume and uniform strain'2 LA, where L is the specimen length, must remain

Design i f Apparatus for Constant-Stress or Constant-Load Creep Tests
Apparatus has been designed and built for conducting creep tests under constant- stress or constant-load conditions. An exact mathematical solution describing the shape of the cam lever for constant stress is given. This solution applies for the large strains usually found for ductile metals and alloys, as long as the strain is uniform.
The initial specimen length employed in a constant-stress creep test ordinarily is fixed by the dimensions of the cam system used. It is shown by the present analysis that the initial specimen length may be changed if an approximate adjustment is made in
the initial setting of a properly designed cam lever.
The direction of the load axis remains fixed and therefore the apparatus has the ad-
vantage of a more complex level-beam machine. The results of a number of creep tests under constant-stress conditions are reported.

the applied weight. Thus, to maintain a constant stress the fol- and lowing condition must be satisfied:

As the length of the specimen increases, the arc of contact on the small wheel increases by an equivalent amount. Thus the instantaneous specimen length may be written as
L = L0 + (0 - d0)R (2) whore d0 is the angle for the initial positioning of the constant-
stress cam. Eliminating L from equations (1) and (2) leads to I'oLo

This is the equation of the profile of a constant-stress cam.
To design an actual cam profile it is desirable to transform equation (3) into a fixed Cartesian co-ordinate system x, y. To do this it is convenient to consider the rotating co-ordinate system !', z shown in Fig. 3 which is related to the fixed system x, y by
Fig. 3 Diagram showing co-ordinate systems for cam profile
Therefore the initial angular setting for any value of initial length L0 can be determined from

The cam profile is completely determined by the values of the constants a and b. For the cam designed in this work, a = 7.19 inches and 6 = 1.
In a given creep test, the constant-stress cam is used in conjunc- tion with a specimen wheel of given radius R and a specimen of given length La. The initial setting of the cam. is made by set- ting the initial moment arm r0, which according to the definition of the cam constants a and b is given by

It is important to note from this relation that the initial cam setting depends upon the ratio of the wheel radius R to the speci- men length £0. In the test results to be discussed later Lo = R = 1.44 inches. Thus the mechanical advantage ro/R, for the ap- paratus employed in this work is 5. Specimens of different initial lengths may be used with the same cam and wheel, but the initial setting must be changed to satisfy the relation b =

balancing an inverted cam is included lo the left of
and onljr the cam to the right is employed for loading. The load is transmitted through a roller chain which is connected to the cam by a pin inserted through the hole at (a). The rollers of the chain rest on the raised middle ridge of the cam. Thus the dis- tance r of equation (4) is measured from the center of the large hole (b) to the center of the roller at the point on the cam where the chain is tangent to the cam. The loading is accomplished by application of dead weights on a loading pan attached to the free end of the chain.
The cam is attached rigidly to a shaft and specimen loading wheel assembly, shown in Figs. 5(B and C). The shaft of this assembly fits into the large hole (6) of the constant-stress cam and the latter is attached to the assembly by means of bolts through holes (c). The constant-stress cam is attached on one side of the specimen loading wheel, and the constant-load wheel shown in Fig. 5(A) is attached on the opposite side in a similar manner. For constant-load tests the load is transmitted through a roller chain attached to the constant-load wheel by a pin inserted through (a). In a similar manner the load to the specimen is transmitted by a roller chain. One end of this chain is attached to the specimen loading wheel by a pin inserted through (a) of Fig. 5(B). The other end is attached to a universal joint and extension arm as shown in the photograph of the apparatus in Fig. 6. Since the direction of loading does not change, this ap- paratus has the advantage of an intricate level-beam machine. The radii R and p for the specimen-loading wheel and the con- stant-load wheel are measured from the center of the assembly to the centers of the respective rollers.
The shaft of the specimen-loading wheel is supported at each end by heavy-duty roller bearings encased in pillow blocks similar to the one drawn in Fig. 5(D). The roller bearings and pillow blocks employed in the present apparatus have each a capacity of 5000 pounds at ten revolutions per minute. The pillow blocks are rigidly attached to the frame of the creep tester shown in Fig. 6.
Calibration of Apparatus
It has been shown previously that PL = constant during a constant stress test. It follows then that

where P0 is the initial load on the specimen. Equation (13) must be satisfied for any angle 6 at any level of P0.
The present apparatus has been calibrated bj' checking the agreement between measurements of L and P and predictions of equation (13). These measurements were made in the following manner: The furnace shown in Fig. fi was removed from the apparatus and a resistance-gage tj'pe dynamometer sensitive to a change of 0.5 pounds or less was attached to the upper extension arm. Weights were placed on the loading pan until the cam assembly balanced at the initial position of 6 marked by a scribed line on the constant load wheel. An initial reading at zero

￼load was taken on the dynamometer which was then attached to the lower extension arm. A total load of 49.7 pounds was placed on the loading pan. If the initial position of 6 shifted because of elimination of slack, the lower connecting rod, which is in contact with the machine frame by means of a semispherical seat, was adjusted to reset the cam assembly. A reading was taken on the dynamometer and the position of a line scribed on the upper ex- tension arm was fixed on an optical comparator which is sensitive to a change of 10"J inches and is shown in Fig. 6. The comparator remains fixed with respect to the frame.
In calibrating the equipment the lower connecting rod is un- screwed a certain amount out of the lower universal joint. This results in a change in 6, a displacement in the scribed mark on the upper extension rod, which is equivalent to a change in L, and a change in the load P indicated by the dynamometer. The lower connecting rod is adjusted so that the change in d is at intervals of 5 deg up to a total of 30 deg and measurements of L and P are made after each interval. A typical calibration plot is shown in Fig. 7. As predicted by equation (13) a linear relationship with a slope of unit}' is found in Fig. 7 for a plot of L/L0 against P0/P. Calibration of several such creep machines shows an average variation of 0.6 per cent in the measured load P from that pre- dicted by equation (13).
Test Procedures and Results
A limited number of tests under constant-stress conditions have been made with the apparatus described here. Dimensions of the creep specimens employed are shown in Fig. 8. The initial gage length is taken as the total length of the reduced section. The extensometer used is a platinum, tube-rod type shown in
Fig. 9. Each end of the extensometer is clamped by means of set-screws, shown in Fig. 9, to the shoulders of the specimen. Extension is determined during a creep test by measuring with the optical comparator the distance between scribed marks on the tube and rod of the extensometer. A window in the furnace per- mits focusing of the optical comparator onto the extensometer.
The specimen with the extensometer attached is threaded into the upper and lower extension arms and the entire assembly lowered into the furnace and threaded into the universal joints. A small weight is placed on the loading pan so that contact is made in the spherical seat between frame and connccting rod.

￼Upon reaching the desired temperature the cam assembly is positioned to 80 by adjusting the connecting rod. After the tem- perature is stabilized for a period of at least one hour an initial reading is taken on the extensometer. The desired load is placed on the loading tray which is now supported by a mechanical jack. The jack is then lowered and the load applied gently. A reading is taken on the extensometer upon loading and at various inter- vals thereafter. The manner of temperature measurement and control has been reported previously [9].
The material tested thus far is a Type 316 austenitic stainless steel having the following composition: C, 0.07%; Mn, 1.94%; P, 0.01%; S, 0.021%; Si, 0.38%; Cr, 18%; Ni, 11.4%; Mo, 2.15%; Al, 0.003%; and N, 0.043%. Typical creep curves ob- tained on this material at 1300 F are shown in Fig. 10. In each case the test was ended soon after tertiary creep began. The maximum strain reached in these tests is slightly less than 60 per cent. However, the apparatus is designed to cover uniform strains of at least 100 per cent.
The research work which will be conducted in part with the present apparatus will deal with the stress and temperature de- pendence of transient and steady-state creep, the nature of the accompanying substructural changes and initiation of fracture, particularly of the mtercrystalline type [6]. It is hoped that this type of information will lead to a better understanding of the basic aspects of creep behavior. Constant-strain-rate and eon-
stant-load tests are also contemplated to check theories formu- lated on the basis of the present work.

            <Text>CHAPTER 3	EFFECT OF AGING TIME ON MICROSTRUCTURE AND HIGH TEMPERATURE CONSTANT-STRESS CREEP BEHAVIOR 
3.1	Introduction 
		In this chapter, the effects of aging time on the microstructure and high temperature creep behavior of the model alloy Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at.%) is investigated. Constant-stress creep tests were performed at an elevated temperature of 760ºC for specimens first homogenized at 1250ºC and then aged 0, 2.4, 24 or 240 h at 800ºC. 
		Microstructural analysis was performed on the specimens prior to and after each creep test. Microstructural evolution was studied for a non-aged homogenized sample at four points along the creep curve. The microstructural effects of straining at high temperature under a constant stress were also investigated, specifically by comparing precipitated particle quantity at two locations of a crept specimen: one in which the specimen did not feel strain and another at which it did.   
3.2	Experimental
		Creep test specimens were machined from Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) model alloy as described in section 2.2.2. T-bone test specimens were milled to a 3 mm thickness, with a gauge length of 20 mm, width of 3mm and overall length of 35 mm. Each specimen was homogenized for 24 h at 1250ºC as described in section 2.2.3 to produce a single phase material. Specimens were subsequently aged in air at 800ºC for 0, 2.4, 24 or 240 h. 
		Prior to undergoing creep tests, samples were imaged using a Tescan Vega3 SEM outfitted with Bruker Quantax Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) detectors. Back-scattered electrons (BSE) with a working distance of 10 mm and operating voltage of 15 keV were used for microstructural analysis. In preparation for imaging, samples were compression mounted and polished on a turntable using successively finer silicon carbide abrasive paper up to 1200-grit, then with 0.3 µm followed by a finer 0.05 µm alumina powder dissolved in water. Samples were placed on a polishing vibrometer with a thin layer of diluted MasterMet Colloidal Silica Polishing Suspension solution for ~3 h. The samples were washed with a spray of distilled water, methanol and detergent as described in the materials characterization section on Experimental Methods. 
		Elevated temperature constant-stress creep tests were conducted for a duration of 500 h for each aging condition at 760ºC under a 35 MPa load. Each long term 500 h test conducted twice for each aging condition.  Under the conditions tested, it was established that the model alloy would enter the secondary creep regime approximately one hour after the specimen was put into tension by loading. It would remain at a steady state for at least a 750 h duration (the longest duration tested). To capture a representative sample of the creep curve, the duration of each test was 500 h, with the exception of two shorter partial tests. Details of constant-stress creep test procedures may be found in the previous chapter’s testing procedure section 2.3.4.  
		Two partial constant-stress creep tests were conducted to evaluate the alloy’s microstructural changes as it crept over time. Similar test conditions as the full range 500 h creep tests were used for the partial tests. Two specimens were homogenized at 1250ºC but not aged. The first partial test (referred to from here on as “P1”) was run for 3.5 h and the second partial test (referred to from here on as “P2”) ran for a 300 h duration to get representative samples along the creep curve. 
		Upon completion of a test, the furnace was cooled to room temperature and the test specimen was removed from the specimen grips. Creep curves of strain percent over time were produced from the load and displacement data collected. The crept T-bone sample was sectioned into three parts using a diamond saw. Figure 3.1 shows the locations of each section on the T-bone. These three locations (Square, Head and Middle-long) were chosen to explore any differences in precipitate directionality or observable microstructural differences between the three sections. No visible difference was observable, but to quantify these findings, SEM images of a crept T-bone’s head and gauge section were compared side-by-side and the particle size quantified using ImageJ software.

            <Text>INTRODUCTION
Even with the surge in use of renewable energy, for the foreseeable future the primary energy source for power applications is likely to be fossil fuels, particularly with the low price of natural gas.  Using these resources as efficiently as possible for both economic reasons and to minimize carbon dioxide emissions is critical (Viswanathan and Bakker, 2000; Viswanathan et al., 2005). In order for power plants to be more efficient they need to run at higher temperature: an operating temperature increase from 873 K to 1073 K would increase the efficiency from &lt;40% to &gt;50%.  This requires materials that are strong enough, can withstand an environment that may contain not only steam but also sulfur, display good oxidation and corrosion resistance and are economically viable (Viswanathan et al., 2005).   defined goal alloys for (AUSC)    at  lyin 
The martensitic/ferritic alloys that are currently used in power plants are limited to use at operating temperatures ≤873 K (Viswanathan and Bakker, 2000).  Nickel-based superalloys, some titanium alloys, and, possibly, oxide-dispersion strengthened ferritic alloys (Miller et al., 2003, 2005) can satisfy the strength and, at least for nickel-based alloys (Project 463, 2007), the oxidation and corrosion requirements at temperatures ≤933 K.  Unfortunately, these materials are too expensive except for use in specialized applications (Takeyama, 2007).  This critical need for advanced materials for steam turbine components in ultra supercritical power plants has been long recognized and forms the basis of efforts in Japan, Europe and the U.S. (Viswanathan and Bakker 2000; Takeyama, 2007).  


	Recent efforts in this area have focused on devising new austenitic steels strengthened with Laves phases, see Figure 1 (Maziasz, 1989; Takeyama et al., 2001; Takeyama, 2007; Yamamoto et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2008), whose purpose is to provide a “grain boundary (GB) precipitation strengthening mechanism” (Tarigan et al., 2011, 2012). The addition of aluminum can be used to improve oxidation resistance in these alloys (Yamamoto et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b; Brady et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b).  Such alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels have shown promise to decrease our reliance on expensive Nickel-base alloys for aggressive conditions in energy production and chemical processing environments (Brady et al., 2014).  AFAs use alumina instead of chromia as a protective oxide scale for high corrosion resistance since it is known to offer even better protection at high temperatures (Kofstas, 1995; Heubner 2000).  AFA stainless steels were in development as early as the 1970s (McGurty, 1978) and more recently a new family of AFAs has been under development at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL (Yamamoto et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b, 2008, 2011; Brady et al., 2005, 2007a, 2008; 2014).  In the newer grades of AFAs, both B2-structured NiAl and Laves phase precipitates are present on both the GBs and in the austenitic matrix, and MC precipitates or L12-structured Ni3Al precipitates are used to increase the creep strength (Brady et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2008; 2011).  While great strides have been made in these AFA stainless steels, optimization of their properties has been difficult because the effects that different alloying elements and precipitates have on their creep strength is not understood.  The AFA stainless steels studied encompass a wide range of compositions and continued study of this system is needed to find the optimal combination of alloying elements that provide the best creep strength and oxidation resistance with a balance of cost for future commercialization (Brady et al., 2014).  


The aim and intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to elucidate the role of different precipitates, including the effects of different sizes and spacings, and of various elemental additions (carbon, boron, silicon) on the creep behavior of AFA stainless steels. The work will focus on the model alloy Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al. This was chosen because it can be fully solutionized upon annealing at 1523 K and because we have experience with it in our current projects. While working on a specific alloy, the precipitation phenomena and deformation behavior that will be studied in a multi-precipitate alloy have applicability to many alloy systems.  It is worth noting that the proposed work is not an alloy development effort, but is focused on fundamental work that will aid further development (by others) of precipitate-strengthened austenitic alloys.  The work will involve collaborations with two long-standing collaborators: Prof. Simon P. Ringer, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia for Atom probe tomography (APT), and Prof. Paul R. Munroe, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Australia for electron probe microanalysis (EPMA).

FURTHER BACKGROUND
Laves-Phase Strengthened Austenitic Stainless Steels
Takeyama et al. (2001) systematically studied Laves phase precipitation in the austenitic Fe-20Cr-(25-40)Ni-2Nb (in at. %) quaternary alloy system.  The precipitates, which adopt the hexagonal C14 structure, are often referred to as the  phase.  For alloys containing 35 at. % Ni, the precipitates are elongated with many interfacial dislocations, whereas for alloys containing 25 at. % Ni the precipitates are smaller and more equi-axed.  In these Fe-Cr-Ni-Nb alloys, the c/a ratio of the precipitates decreases as the Ni content decreases for 15-25 at. % Ni and changes little with further increases in Ni content.  At 25 at. % Ni the c/a ratio is about the same as that of binary stoichiometric Fe2Nb at 1.63, which is near the value for the cubic symmetry C15 Laves structure.  Although the precipitates are referred to by Takeyama (2007) as Fe2Nb, they contain 14-15 at. % Cr, 26 at. % Nb and 17-25 at. %  Ni, depending on the overall alloy composition.  Takeyama (2007) determined TTT curves for the precipitates and found that precipitation at 1173-1273 K occurred first on the grain GBs after ~300 s, but only after &gt;1000 s in the matrix.  After long ageing times (4.32 x 106 s) the precipitates on the GBs became significantly larger (≤ 3 µm).  
In contrast, Yamamoto et al. (2007b) found that the  Laves phase precipitates in the matrix of the alloy Fe-15Cr-20Ni-(1-2)Nb were relatively stable during both ageing and creep testing at 1073 K.  This stability may arise partly from the semi-coherent interface of the Fe2Nb precipitates, as indicated by the strain contrast present in transmission electron microscope (TEM) images even after long-term annealing (Takeyama, 2007), and also from the presence of small additions of Al, Mo, C and B.  Small elemental additions have also been shown to stabilize Laves phases in other systems: Maziasz (1989) noted that Si additions led to the formation of Fe2(Mo,Nb) precipitates in austenitic alloys, while Yamamoto et al. (2008) found that small Zr additions promote Fe2Ti Laves phase precipitates.
	Yamamoto et al. (2008) studied the microstructural evolution of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb alloys with and without additions of 0.4 Si, 0.2 Zr or 5.0 Al (in at. %) during creep at 1023 K and 100 MPa.  The Si addition helped to both refine the particle size (from ~1 µm to 300 nm) and produce a greater volume fraction of particles during ageing at 1073 K, and stabilized them against coarsening, resulting in superior creep resistance.  Interestingly, alloys that were only solution treated showed superior creep properties to those that were aged prior to creep testing.  The authors speculated that this phenomenon was because the particles that were dynamically precipitated during creep were finer (300-400 nm) and, thus, more effective at pinning dislocations.  The Zr addition improved the creep resistance more dramatically than the Si additions possibly by stabilizing very fine -Ni3Nb particles.  The addition of Al not only improved the creep resistance due to the formation of 30 nm diameter Ni3Al precipitates, but also improved the oxidation through the formation of a protective alumina layer on the surface.
The fundamental issues with the use of austenitic alloys for high temperature applications were articulated by Yamamoto et al. (2008) who noted that “The strengthening effect of Fe2Nb (Laves phase) strongly depends on its size and volume fraction, indicating that the thermal stability of the particle size and distributions is the key to improve creep properties.”  More specifically, the two key issues are that: 1) the increase in size and density of the large Laves phase particles that develop on the GBs during creep testing (Yamamoto et al. 2008) will ultimately result in specimen failure when the GB coverage of these brittle particles is large enough; and 2) further refinement of the Laves phase precipitates to ~100 nm dia. is necessary to improve the creep strength Yamamoto et al. (2008).  
Recently, Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) examined the effect of boron (0.03%) on the creep strength of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (in at. %).  Both the boron-doped and boron-free alloys contained Ni3Nb precipitates (the ” phase at short annealing times and the  phase at long times) within the grains and Laves phase precipitates on the GBs. The boron decreased the creep rate and increased the creep rupture life by a factor of almost four.  The role of boron appeared to be to increase the extent of the Laves phase precipitation at the GBs.  Simply aging the boron-free alloy to increase the extent of GB coverage by the Laves phase from 52% to 89% also increased the creep rupture life, and decreased the creep rate to a similar extent as the boron addition.  That even with 89% GB coverage by the Laves phase precipitates a creep rupture strain of 77% was attained shows that the precipitates don’t necessarily embrittle the alloy. Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) found that the creep rate,, was related to the area fraction covered by the GB Laves phase, , according to: 
/0 (1- 					- (1)
0 is the creep rate when  = 0. This idea is similar to earlier observations that in a Ni-20Cr-20W alloy the minimum creep rate decreased linearly with increasing density of an intergranular 2 phase (Matsuo et al., 1987), and that increasing GB carbide precipitation in Ni-20 Cr and Fe-15Cr-25 Ni alloys increased their creep resistance (Zhang et al., 1987, 1989a, 1989b, 1991).  Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) suggested that the role of the GB phase was to suppress deformation at the GBs, whereas Zhang et al.’s (1989a, 1991) TEM observations suggested that the GB precipitation was associated with higher dislocation densities that strengthened the GB region.
Chen et al. (2014) also studied Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb with and without 0.03% B and found that boron both increased the extent and produced finer Laves phase precipitates on the GBs, but by &lt;10% after their longest anneal of 24h, when the GB coverage in the B-doped alloy was ~80%.  Using an EPMA, they showed strong boron segregation to the GBs.  They found that for both the boron-doped and boron-free alloy, longer aging times prior to creep testing increased the creep life (by up to 100% for a 4 h versus a 12 h anneal), and that for the same aging time boron doping increased the creep life (by up to 44% for short aging times but by less at long aging times) by producing greater GB coverage of the Laves phase.  Chen et al.’s (2014) results were very similar to those of Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012).  Essentially, boron appears to reduce the annealing time to obtain a large GB coverage by the Laves phase. 

Alumina-Forming Austenitic Stainless Steels
Even within particular grades of AFAs, the influence of specific precipitates on creep strength is complex.  A wide variety of creep strengths can be obtained with relatively small changes in alloying elements, and phases that are beneficial in some AFAs appear to cause decreased creep strength in others.  There are three grades of AFAs that have been investigated by the ORNL group based on their nickel content, viz., 20-25Ni, 12Ni, and 32Ni. The 12Ni grade alloys substitute Mn for some of the Ni both to stabilize the austenite relative to the deleterious –Fe phase and to lower the cost.  Unfortunately, this grade has been shown to have relatively poor creep resistance although the reason for the decreased creep strength is poorly understood (Brady et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2011).  In 20-25 Ni grade alloys it has been found that the total weight fraction of carbide phases is important.  For example, in a 20-25Ni grade alloy with 2.53 wt. % Nb and 0.2 wt. % C there was little MC supersaturation and it showed poor creep resistance compared to 25Ni grade alloys with 1 wt.% Nb and 0.1 wt. % C.  It is believed that the 2.53 wt.% Nb alloy showed poorer creep strength because the 2.53 wt.% Nb addition decreased the supersaturation of MC carbides (Brady et al., 2014).  The 1 wt. % Nb and 0.1 wt. % C additions have been shown to be the optimal amounts for MC carbide strengthening in other studies of AFAs as well (Brady et al, 2008; Yamamoto et al., 2009).  While increasing the Nb content from 1 wt. % to 2.5 wt. % seemed to have a detrimental role on the creep strength for a 25Ni alloy, in the 32Ni grade alloys with 3.3 wt. % Nb, superior creep strength has been observed at 923 K, a feature that appears to be due to strengthening from L12 Ni3Al precipitates, producing a creep strength almost five times greater than the best carbide strengthened 20-25 Ni alloy.  While the L12 Ni3Al improved the creep properties of the 32Ni alloy, at 923 K it is believed that the metastable L12 Ni3Al caused the decreased rupture time observed in a 25Ni-4Al-1Nb alloy with increased C content compared to a 25Ni-3Al-1Nb alloy. Although the creep strength was promising there was a tradeoff with significantly reduced creep elongation in the 32Ni grade alloy, which is thought to be due to σ-phase formation.  At 1023 K, the 32Ni alloy creep results were comparable to those of both the 20-25Ni and 12Ni alloy grades (Brady et al., 2014). 
	Similarly, Dong et al. (2013) studied the creep behavior of Fe-19.95Ni-14.19Cr-2.25Al-2.26Mo-1.95Mn-0.15Si-0.01B (wt.%) at 973 K and 150 MPa and found that an alloy with 0.86 % Nb and 0.07 % C had poor creep behavior due to the relatively coarse (100 nm) NbC, whereas a similar alloy with a lower carbon content (0.04 %) had much smaller carbides (10 nm) and much improved creep properties. An alloy with the same carbon content but lower Nb (0.5%) and the addition of  0.2% V had had even better creep properties due to the formation of (Nb,V)C.  Both Laves phase and NiAl were found to be present after the creep testing, but Dong et al. (2013) questioned whether they contributed to the creep strength.
	32Ni grade alloys with decreased chromium content (14 wt. % versus 19 wt. %) and additional alloying elements such as Zr and Ti have less σ-phase formation and improved creep properties.  Indeed, a Zr, Ti alloyed 32Ni alloy with additions of carbon and boron was shown to have a creep-rupture life that exceeded that of the commercially-available Fe-base alloy A286 by an order of magnitude (Yamamoto, Muralidharan, Brady, 2013).  Boron improves the creep properties of AFA stainless steels, but why is not understood. Unlike the Al-free Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb alloy studied by both Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) and Chen et al. (2014), the addition of boron to a 32Ni grade alloy did not seem to have a significant effect on GB precipitation, and in this case it was hypothesized that the boron addition formed a strain field in the matrix that increased resistance to creep deformation (Yamamoto, Muralidharan, Brady, 2013).  It is worth noting that unlike the Al-free alloys in which a solutionizing anneal can completely dissolve the Laves phase precipitates, in the more complex alloys developed at ORNL solutionizing anneals still leave substantial volume fractions of the Laves phase in the material (Yamamoto, Muralidharan, Brady, 2013; Brady et al., 2014, Hu et al., 2014).
	While computational methods have helped in the design AFA alloys to limit the formation of deleterious phases, such as the sigma phase, and to help stabilize the austenitic matrix, it is clear that the additions of small alloying elements and their effect on the properties of AFA stainless steels require more detailed microstructural characterization. Even with an understanding of what phases may be present, creep mechanisms in this system are not well enough understood to predict which potential strengthening precipitate will be most beneficial for creep strength.  For many of the AFA alloys that were also tensile tested, the creep and elevated temperature tensile properties did not correlate well.  For example in the 20-25 Ni grade alloys while B2-NiAl and Laves precipitation improves tensile properties, MC carbides appear to show a stronger influence on the creep strength (Brady et al, 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2011).  The ORNL group also questioned whether the Laves phase even had any significant influence on the creep strength (Bei et al., 2010). The lower tensile strength they observed in these alloys at 1023 K compared to room temperature appeared to be due to the softening of the B2 NiAl phase which produces significant strengthening at room temperature. This lack of correlation between the elevated temperature yield strength and the creep life is well illustrated in the data presented by Dong et al. (2013), see Table 1, although the UTS and strain hardening exponent did show roughly the same trend as the creep life.

The Intellectual Merit of this Activity was to understand both the effects of deformation on the precipitation processes in Laves phase-strengthened austenitic steels, including determining the mechanism of NiAl co-precipitation, and how these two kinds of precipitates affect subsequent room-temperature deformation processes.  

The Broader Impacts of the Activity include the education of a black American female Ph.D. student, Geneva Trotter, a female American M.S. student, Natalie Afonina, and four undergraduates Yi (Annie) Sun, Sean J. Oh, Hughes Lee and Skyler Perot.  Two observations in the work have broad applicability to alloy design in other systems: (1) cold work can lead to more rapid precipitation of a higher volume fraction of finer precipitates; and (2) even with almost complete coverage of the GBs by a brittle phase substantial room temperature tensile ductility can still be achieved (details are given below). The work has been disseminated by the publication of three journal papers (Trotter et al., 2014a; Trotter and Baker, 2015a, Hu et al. 2015), a paper recently submitted to a journal (Trotter and Baker, 2015b), and through eight conference presentations (Trotter, Rayner and Baker, 2012, 2013a, 2013b; Trotter et al. 2014b, 2014c; Hu, et al., 2014; Trotter and Baker, 2015c, d).  The work involved collaborations with Drs. M.K. Miller and L. Yao (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), Drs. S. Chen and Z. Cai (Argonne National Laboratory) and Prof. P.R. Munroe (University of New South Wales, Australia).
	In this work we studied the effects of cold work on the simplified AFA stainless steel Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) - many of the alloys studied by the ORNL Group are much more complex containing 10 or so elements (Brady et al., 2014).  Cold rolling was performed, after solution treatment at 1523 K, to 25%, 50% and 90% rolling reductions with subsequent ageing performed for various times at 973 K, 1073 K and 1173 K. A significant density of dislocations was found in the matrix in the solutionized and aged specimens even without cold rolling, possibly due to the punching out of dislocations from around the precipitates during cooling, see Figure 2. 


                     













We found that cold work accelerated the precipitation kinetics of both the C14-type Fe2Nb-type Laves phase and the B2-type NiAl precipitates markedly compared to simply aging, presumably due to heterogeneous precipitation on dislocations, see Figure 3.  It is worth noting that in the material that was simply aged the Laves phase precipitates nucleate before the B2 precipitates, but it is no longer clear that this sequence occurs after cold work and aging, see Figure 3.

Backscattered electron images from specimens aged at 1073 K: a) 2.4 h; b) 2.4 h after 50% cold work; c) 24 h after 90% cold work; d) 24 h; e) 24 h after 50% cold work, 24 h; f) 240 h after 90% cold work; g) 240 h; h) 240 h after 50% cold work; and i) 240 h after 90% cold work.  The particles with light contrast are the Laves phase; the particles with dark contrast are NiAl. From Trotter et al. (2014a).
While often co-located, the Laves phase and B2 particles are distinct, see Figure 4. L12 (ordered f.c.c.) precipitates were also observed in samples aged at 973 K with 90% prior cold work, see Figure 5, but not in specimens annealed at 1073 K, which is in line with thermodynamic calculations. The additional fine L12 precipitates present at 973 K are presumably the reason for the greater hardness of the 973 K-annealed material (Trotter et al., 2014a). We have shown using APT that the L12 precipitates are Ni3(Al,Ti), see Figure 67. Compared to material that had not been strained, defects introduced by cold work not only caused more rapid precipitation in the matrix but also an increaseincreased in the total volume fraction of precipitates as compared to material that had been simply aged, see Figure 3.  Histograms of the particle size distributions were produced for each annealing time and temperature (not shown here), and, as might be expected, they were lognormal with the particle size increasing steady with increasing time and increasing temperature (Trotter et al., 2014a).

The Al and Nb maps are overlaid to show that the two types of precipitates (Laves and B2), while often co-located, are distinct. After Trotter et al. (2014a).

Similar to the accelerating effects of a boron addition on the Laves phase precipitation in Al-free Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb observed by Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) and Chen et al. (2014), we have found that silicon additions to an AFA steel with a composition that despite having less Laves phase-forming Nb (Fe-15Cr-23Ni-1.5Nb-7Al-0.2Si at. %) had increased precipitation kinetics, decreased precipitate size and an increase in the overall volume fraction of both the Laves phase and NiAl precipitates (Trotter, Baker and Munroe, 2014), see Figure 78.  As noted earlier, Yamamoto et al. (2008) found that Si additions produced a decrease in precipitate size and a greater volume fraction of precipitates.

            <Text>INTRODUCTION
Even with the surge in use of renewable energy, for the foreseeable future the primary energy source for power applications is likely to be fossil fuels, particularly with the low price of natural gas.  Using these resources as efficiently as possible for both economic reasons and to minimize carbon dioxide emissions is critical (Viswanathan and Bakker, 2000; Viswanathan et al., 2005). In order for power plants to be more efficient they need to run at higher temperature: an operating temperature increase from 873 K to 1073 K would increase the efficiency from &lt;40% to &gt;50%.  This requires materials that are strong enough, can withstand an environment that may contain not only steam but also sulfur, display good oxidation and corrosion resistance and are economically viable (Viswanathan et al., 2005).   defined goal alloys for (AUSC)    at  lyin 
The martensitic/ferritic alloys that are currently used in power plants are limited to use at operating temperatures ≤873 K (Viswanathan and Bakker, 2000).  Nickel-based superalloys, some titanium alloys, and, possibly, oxide-dispersion strengthened ferritic alloys (Miller et al., 2003, 2005) can satisfy the strength and, at least for nickel-based alloys (Project 463, 2007), the oxidation and corrosion requirements at temperatures ≤933 K.  Unfortunately, these materials are too expensive except for use in specialized applications (Takeyama, 2007).  This critical need for advanced materials for steam turbine components in ultra supercritical power plants has been long recognized and forms the basis of efforts in Japan, Europe and the U.S. (Viswanathan and Bakker 2000; Takeyama, 2007).  


	Recent efforts in this area have focused on devising new austenitic steels strengthened with Laves phases, see Figure 1 (Maziasz, 1989; Takeyama et al., 2001; Takeyama, 2007; Yamamoto et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2008), whose purpose is to provide a “grain boundary (GB) precipitation strengthening mechanism” (Tarigan et al., 2011, 2012). The addition of aluminum can be used to improve oxidation resistance in these alloys (Yamamoto et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b; Brady et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b).  Such alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels have shown promise to decrease our reliance on expensive Nickel-base alloys for aggressive conditions in energy production and chemical processing environments (Brady et al., 2014).  AFAs use alumina instead of chromia as a protective oxide scale for high corrosion resistance since it is known to offer even better protection at high temperatures (Kofstas, 1995; Heubner 2000).  AFA stainless steels were in development as early as the 1970s (McGurty, 1978) and more recently a new family of AFAs has been under development at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL (Yamamoto et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b, 2008, 2011; Brady et al., 2005, 2007a, 2008; 2014).  In the newer grades of AFAs, both B2-structured NiAl and Laves phase precipitates are present on both the GBs and in the austenitic matrix, and MC precipitates or L12-structured Ni3Al precipitates are used to increase the creep strength (Brady et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2008; 2011).  While great strides have been made in these AFA stainless steels, optimization of their properties has been difficult because the effects that different alloying elements and precipitates have on their creep strength is not understood.  The AFA stainless steels studied encompass a wide range of compositions and continued study of this system is needed to find the optimal combination of alloying elements that provide the best creep strength and oxidation resistance with a balance of cost for future commercialization (Brady et al., 2014).  


The aim and intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to elucidate the role of different precipitates, including the effects of different sizes and spacings, and of various elemental additions (carbon, boron, silicon) on the creep behavior of AFA stainless steels. The work will focus on the model alloy Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al. This was chosen because it can be fully solutionized upon annealing at 1523 K and because we have experience with it in our current projects. While working on a specific alloy, the precipitation phenomena and deformation behavior that will be studied in a multi-precipitate alloy have applicability to many alloy systems.  It is worth noting that the proposed work is not an alloy development effort, but is focused on fundamental work that will aid further development (by others) of precipitate-strengthened austenitic alloys.  The work will involve collaborations with two long-standing collaborators: Prof. Simon P. Ringer, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia for Atom probe tomography (APT), and Prof. Paul R. Munroe, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Australia for electron probe microanalysis (EPMA).

FURTHER BACKGROUND
Laves-Phase Strengthened Austenitic Stainless Steels
Takeyama et al. (2001) systematically studied Laves phase precipitation in the austenitic Fe-20Cr-(25-40)Ni-2Nb (in at. %) quaternary alloy system.  The precipitates, which adopt the hexagonal C14 structure, are often referred to as the  phase.  For alloys containing 35 at. % Ni, the precipitates are elongated with many interfacial dislocations, whereas for alloys containing 25 at. % Ni the precipitates are smaller and more equi-axed.  In these Fe-Cr-Ni-Nb alloys, the c/a ratio of the precipitates decreases as the Ni content decreases for 15-25 at. % Ni and changes little with further increases in Ni content.  At 25 at. % Ni the c/a ratio is about the same as that of binary stoichiometric Fe2Nb at 1.63, which is near the value for the cubic symmetry C15 Laves structure.  Although the precipitates are referred to by Takeyama (2007) as Fe2Nb, they contain 14-15 at. % Cr, 26 at. % Nb and 17-25 at. %  Ni, depending on the overall alloy composition.  Takeyama (2007) determined TTT curves for the precipitates and found that precipitation at 1173-1273 K occurred first on the grain GBs after ~300 s, but only after &gt;1000 s in the matrix.  After long ageing times (4.32 x 106 s) the precipitates on the GBs became significantly larger (≤ 3 µm).  
In contrast, Yamamoto et al. (2007b) found that the  Laves phase precipitates in the matrix of the alloy Fe-15Cr-20Ni-(1-2)Nb were relatively stable during both ageing and creep testing at 1073 K.  This stability may arise partly from the semi-coherent interface of the Fe2Nb precipitates, as indicated by the strain contrast present in transmission electron microscope (TEM) images even after long-term annealing (Takeyama, 2007), and also from the presence of small additions of Al, Mo, C and B.  Small elemental additions have also been shown to stabilize Laves phases in other systems: Maziasz (1989) noted that Si additions led to the formation of Fe2(Mo,Nb) precipitates in austenitic alloys, while Yamamoto et al. (2008) found that small Zr additions promote Fe2Ti Laves phase precipitates.
	Yamamoto et al. (2008) studied the microstructural evolution of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb alloys with and without additions of 0.4 Si, 0.2 Zr or 5.0 Al (in at. %) during creep at 1023 K and 100 MPa.  The Si addition helped to both refine the particle size (from ~1 µm to 300 nm) and produce a greater volume fraction of particles during ageing at 1073 K, and stabilized them against coarsening, resulting in superior creep resistance.  Interestingly, alloys that were only solution treated showed superior creep properties to those that were aged prior to creep testing.  The authors speculated that this phenomenon was because the particles that were dynamically precipitated during creep were finer (300-400 nm) and, thus, more effective at pinning dislocations.  The Zr addition improved the creep resistance more dramatically than the Si additions possibly by stabilizing very fine -Ni3Nb particles.  The addition of Al not only improved the creep resistance due to the formation of 30 nm diameter Ni3Al precipitates, but also improved the oxidation through the formation of a protective alumina layer on the surface.
The fundamental issues with the use of austenitic alloys for high temperature applications were articulated by Yamamoto et al. (2008) who noted that “The strengthening effect of Fe2Nb (Laves phase) strongly depends on its size and volume fraction, indicating that the thermal stability of the particle size and distributions is the key to improve creep properties.”  More specifically, the two key issues are that: 1) the increase in size and density of the large Laves phase particles that develop on the GBs during creep testing (Yamamoto et al. 2008) will ultimately result in specimen failure when the GB coverage of these brittle particles is large enough; and 2) further refinement of the Laves phase precipitates to ~100 nm dia. is necessary to improve the creep strength Yamamoto et al. (2008).  
Recently, Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) examined the effect of boron (0.03%) on the creep strength of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (in at. %).  Both the boron-doped and boron-free alloys contained Ni3Nb precipitates (the ” phase at short annealing times and the  phase at long times) within the grains and Laves phase precipitates on the GBs. The boron decreased the creep rate and increased the creep rupture life by a factor of almost four.  The role of boron appeared to be to increase the extent of the Laves phase precipitation at the GBs.  Simply aging the boron-free alloy to increase the extent of GB coverage by the Laves phase from 52% to 89% also increased the creep rupture life, and decreased the creep rate to a similar extent as the boron addition.  That even with 89% GB coverage by the Laves phase precipitates a creep rupture strain of 77% was attained shows that the precipitates don’t necessarily embrittle the alloy. Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) found that the creep rate,, was related to the area fraction covered by the GB Laves phase, , according to: 
/0 (1- 					- (1)
0 is the creep rate when  = 0. This idea is similar to earlier observations that in a Ni-20Cr-20W alloy the minimum creep rate decreased linearly with increasing density of an intergranular 2 phase (Matsuo et al., 1987), and that increasing GB carbide precipitation in Ni-20 Cr and Fe-15Cr-25 Ni alloys increased their creep resistance (Zhang et al., 1987, 1989a, 1989b, 1991).  Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) suggested that the role of the GB phase was to suppress deformation at the GBs, whereas Zhang et al.’s (1989a, 1991) TEM observations suggested that the GB precipitation was associated with higher dislocation densities that strengthened the GB region.
Chen et al. (2014) also studied Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb with and without 0.03% B and found that boron both increased the extent and produced finer Laves phase precipitates on the GBs, but by &lt;10% after their longest anneal of 24h, when the GB coverage in the B-doped alloy was ~80%.  Using an EPMA, they showed strong boron segregation to the GBs.  They found that for both the boron-doped and boron-free alloy, longer aging times prior to creep testing increased the creep life (by up to 100% for a 4 h versus a 12 h anneal), and that for the same aging time boron doping increased the creep life (by up to 44% for short aging times but by less at long aging times) by producing greater GB coverage of the Laves phase.  Chen et al.’s (2014) results were very similar to those of Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012).  Essentially, boron appears to reduce the annealing time to obtain a large GB coverage by the Laves phase. 

Alumina-Forming Austenitic Stainless Steels
Even within particular grades of AFAs, the influence of specific precipitates on creep strength is complex.  A wide variety of creep strengths can be obtained with relatively small changes in alloying elements, and phases that are beneficial in some AFAs appear to cause decreased creep strength in others.  There are three grades of AFAs that have been investigated by the ORNL group based on their nickel content, viz., 20-25Ni, 12Ni, and 32Ni. The 12Ni grade alloys substitute Mn for some of the Ni both to stabilize the austenite relative to the deleterious –Fe phase and to lower the cost.  Unfortunately, this grade has been shown to have relatively poor creep resistance although the reason for the decreased creep strength is poorly understood (Brady et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2011).  In 20-25 Ni grade alloys it has been found that the total weight fraction of carbide phases is important.  For example, in a 20-25Ni grade alloy with 2.53 wt. % Nb and 0.2 wt. % C there was little MC supersaturation and it showed poor creep resistance compared to 25Ni grade alloys with 1 wt.% Nb and 0.1 wt. % C.  It is believed that the 2.53 wt.% Nb alloy showed poorer creep strength because the 2.53 wt.% Nb addition decreased the supersaturation of MC carbides (Brady et al., 2014).  The 1 wt. % Nb and 0.1 wt. % C additions have been shown to be the optimal amounts for MC carbide strengthening in other studies of AFAs as well (Brady et al, 2008; Yamamoto et al., 2009).  While increasing the Nb content from 1 wt. % to 2.5 wt. % seemed to have a detrimental role on the creep strength for a 25Ni alloy, in the 32Ni grade alloys with 3.3 wt. % Nb, superior creep strength has been observed at 923 K, a feature that appears to be due to strengthening from L12 Ni3Al precipitates, producing a creep strength almost five times greater than the best carbide strengthened 20-25 Ni alloy.  While the L12 Ni3Al improved the creep properties of the 32Ni alloy, at 923 K it is believed that the metastable L12 Ni3Al caused the decreased rupture time observed in a 25Ni-4Al-1Nb alloy with increased C content compared to a 25Ni-3Al-1Nb alloy. Although the creep strength was promising there was a tradeoff with significantly reduced creep elongation in the 32Ni grade alloy, which is thought to be due to σ-phase formation.  At 1023 K, the 32Ni alloy creep results were comparable to those of both the 20-25Ni and 12Ni alloy grades (Brady et al., 2014). 
	Similarly, Dong et al. (2013) studied the creep behavior of Fe-19.95Ni-14.19Cr-2.25Al-2.26Mo-1.95Mn-0.15Si-0.01B (wt.%) at 973 K and 150 MPa and found that an alloy with 0.86 % Nb and 0.07 % C had poor creep behavior due to the relatively coarse (100 nm) NbC, whereas a similar alloy with a lower carbon content (0.04 %) had much smaller carbides (10 nm) and much improved creep properties. An alloy with the same carbon content but lower Nb (0.5%) and the addition of  0.2% V had had even better creep properties due to the formation of (Nb,V)C.  Both Laves phase and NiAl were found to be present after the creep testing, but Dong et al. (2013) questioned whether they contributed to the creep strength.
	32Ni grade alloys with decreased chromium content (14 wt. % versus 19 wt. %) and additional alloying elements such as Zr and Ti have less σ-phase formation and improved creep properties.  Indeed, a Zr, Ti alloyed 32Ni alloy with additions of carbon and boron was shown to have a creep-rupture life that exceeded that of the commercially-available Fe-base alloy A286 by an order of magnitude (Yamamoto, Muralidharan, Brady, 2013).  Boron improves the creep properties of AFA stainless steels, but why is not understood. Unlike the Al-free Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb alloy studied by both Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) and Chen et al. (2014), the addition of boron to a 32Ni grade alloy did not seem to have a significant effect on GB precipitation, and in this case it was hypothesized that the boron addition formed a strain field in the matrix that increased resistance to creep deformation (Yamamoto, Muralidharan, Brady, 2013).  It is worth noting that unlike the Al-free alloys in which a solutionizing anneal can completely dissolve the Laves phase precipitates, in the more complex alloys developed at ORNL solutionizing anneals still leave substantial volume fractions of the Laves phase in the material (Yamamoto, Muralidharan, Brady, 2013; Brady et al., 2014, Hu et al., 2014).
	While computational methods have helped in the design AFA alloys to limit the formation of deleterious phases, such as the sigma phase, and to help stabilize the austenitic matrix, it is clear that the additions of small alloying elements and their effect on the properties of AFA stainless steels require more detailed microstructural characterization. Even with an understanding of what phases may be present, creep mechanisms in this system are not well enough understood to predict which potential strengthening precipitate will be most beneficial for creep strength.  For many of the AFA alloys that were also tensile tested, the creep and elevated temperature tensile properties did not correlate well.  For example in the 20-25 Ni grade alloys while B2-NiAl and Laves precipitation improves tensile properties, MC carbides appear to show a stronger influence on the creep strength (Brady et al, 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2011).  The ORNL group also questioned whether the Laves phase even had any significant influence on the creep strength (Bei et al., 2010). The lower tensile strength they observed in these alloys at 1023 K compared to room temperature appeared to be due to the softening of the B2 NiAl phase which produces significant strengthening at room temperature. This lack of correlation between the elevated temperature yield strength and the creep life is well illustrated in the data presented by Dong et al. (2013), see Table 1, although the UTS and strain hardening exponent did show roughly the same trend as the creep life.

The Intellectual Merit of this Activity was to understand both the effects of deformation on the precipitation processes in Laves phase-strengthened austenitic steels, including determining the mechanism of NiAl co-precipitation, and how these two kinds of precipitates affect subsequent room-temperature deformation processes.  

The Broader Impacts of the Activity include the education of a black American female Ph.D. student, Geneva Trotter, a female American M.S. student, Natalie Afonina, and four undergraduates Yi (Annie) Sun, Sean J. Oh, Hughes Lee and Skyler Perot.  Two observations in the work have broad applicability to alloy design in other systems: (1) cold work can lead to more rapid precipitation of a higher volume fraction of finer precipitates; and (2) even with almost complete coverage of the GBs by a brittle phase substantial room temperature tensile ductility can still be achieved (details are given below). The work has been disseminated by the publication of three journal papers (Trotter et al., 2014a; Trotter and Baker, 2015a, Hu et al. 2015), a paper recently submitted to a journal (Trotter and Baker, 2015b), and through eight conference presentations (Trotter, Rayner and Baker, 2012, 2013a, 2013b; Trotter et al. 2014b, 2014c; Hu, et al., 2014; Trotter and Baker, 2015c, d).  The work involved collaborations with Drs. M.K. Miller and L. Yao (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), Drs. S. Chen and Z. Cai (Argonne National Laboratory) and Prof. P.R. Munroe (University of New South Wales, Australia).
	In this work we studied the effects of cold work on the simplified AFA stainless steel Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) - many of the alloys studied by the ORNL Group are much more complex containing 10 or so elements (Brady et al., 2014).  Cold rolling was performed, after solution treatment at 1523 K, to 25%, 50% and 90% rolling reductions with subsequent ageing performed for various times at 973 K, 1073 K and 1173 K. A significant density of dislocations was found in the matrix in the solutionized and aged specimens even without cold rolling, possibly due to the punching out of dislocations from around the precipitates during cooling, see Figure 2. 


                     













We found that cold work accelerated the precipitation kinetics of both the C14-type Fe2Nb-type Laves phase and the B2-type NiAl precipitates markedly compared to simply aging, presumably due to heterogeneous precipitation on dislocations, see Figure 3.  It is worth noting that in the material that was simply aged the Laves phase precipitates nucleate before the B2 precipitates, but it is no longer clear that this sequence occurs after cold work and aging, see Figure 3.

Backscattered electron images from specimens aged at 1073 K: a) 2.4 h; b) 2.4 h after 50% cold work; c) 24 h after 90% cold work; d) 24 h; e) 24 h after 50% cold work, 24 h; f) 240 h after 90% cold work; g) 240 h; h) 240 h after 50% cold work; and i) 240 h after 90% cold work.  The particles with light contrast are the Laves phase; the particles with dark contrast are NiAl. From Trotter et al. (2014a).
While often co-located, the Laves phase and B2 particles are distinct, see Figure 4. L12 (ordered f.c.c.) precipitates were also observed in samples aged at 973 K with 90% prior cold work, see Figure 5, but not in specimens annealed at 1073 K, which is in line with thermodynamic calculations. The additional fine L12 precipitates present at 973 K are presumably the reason for the greater hardness of the 973 K-annealed material (Trotter et al., 2014a). We have shown using APT that the L12 precipitates are Ni3(Al,Ti), see Figure 67. Compared to material that had not been strained, defects introduced by cold work not only caused more rapid precipitation in the matrix but also an increaseincreased in the total volume fraction of precipitates as compared to material that had been simply aged, see Figure 3.  Histograms of the particle size distributions were produced for each annealing time and temperature (not shown here), and, as might be expected, they were lognormal with the particle size increasing steady with increasing time and increasing temperature (Trotter et al., 2014a).

The Al and Nb maps are overlaid to show that the two types of precipitates (Laves and B2), while often co-located, are distinct. After Trotter et al. (2014a).

Similar to the accelerating effects of a boron addition on the Laves phase precipitation in Al-free Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb observed by Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) and Chen et al. (2014), we have found that silicon additions to an AFA steel with a composition that despite having less Laves phase-forming Nb (Fe-15Cr-23Ni-1.5Nb-7Al-0.2Si at. %) had increased precipitation kinetics, decreased precipitate size and an increase in the overall volume fraction of both the Laves phase and NiAl precipitates (Trotter, Baker and Munroe, 2014), see Figure 78.  As noted earlier, Yamamoto et al. (2008) found that Si additions produced a decrease in precipitate size and a greater volume fraction of precipitates.

￼SUMMARY
The phenomenon of a metal elongating to 1000 percent or more, known as superplasticity, has only recently been investigated. It has been shown that the deformation of a superplastic metal can
be described by available creep theories. This thesis proposed to investigate the creep of a known superplastic material and allow the grain size to vary in the coarse grain size range, in order to determine which available theory would describe the deformation. The material chosen for the investigation is high purity zinc.
A constant stress creep machine was designed and constructed, since it was necessary to hold stress constant in the study. Bamboo structured and coarse-grain polycrystalline specimens were fabricated
with varying large grain sizes. Creep tests were conducted holding stress and temperature constant while monitoring strain rate.
For the bamboo structured specimens, results showed an
indeterminate correlation between grain size and strain rate because localized necking of select grains of the specimens occurred. A linear relationship between grain size and strain rate was found for coarse- grain polycrystalline specimens. This linear relationship between strain rate and grain size does not agree with any of the common theories for creep.

INTRODUCTION
Significance of the Investigation
An efficient way to commercially apply a phenomenon is to
have its theory known first. But contrary to the general opinion, this Is seldom the case with materials of construction. Glass was
in use for three millenia before its structure was even vaguely known. Also, martensite was used long before its mechanism was known and Duralumin was used almost a decade before the rudiments of its theory were developed. The phenomenon of a metal plastically deforming to elongations of 1000 percent or more, known as superplasticity, falls into this category. Its application to current industrial metal forming problems has received much attention while the theory of the phenomenon is being formulated simultaneously.
In 1920, Rosenhain [1]* observed a molten glass-like behavior in a cold rolled zinc-copper-aluminum ternary alloy. Few other reports of great plastic deformations are recorded until Pearson [2] reported an amazing 2000 percent elongation in a tin-bismuth eutectic alloy in 193^-. Such reports went unnoticed until 1962, when a review
[3] of previous experiments by Industry resulted in research and development of the phenomenon [^-,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]. Currently, several aerospace companies are developing superplastic vacuum forming

￼and high ductility forging processes for use in manufacturing of
parts peculiar to that industry [^-,7] • Also, the automobile industry is investigating superplastic forming of sheet metals for use in car bodies [^-,5] * At the same time, a theory of plasticity is being developed to model the phenomenon. The most recent of the theoretical works by Hayden, Floreen, and Goodell [12] has applied creep theories to model superplasticity. This model is in good agreement with metallographic investigations by Nicholson [13]. However, quantitative measurements concerning deformation mechanisms of only a few super- plastic materials has "been 'reported in the literature, and no single theory can account for the differences observed in them.
Pure zinc (99«99+$&gt;)&gt; as well as zinc of commercial purity, has been reported to be a superplastic metal [^-,8]. Investigations into
single crystal creep properties [1^,15,l6,17,39] has been rather extensive, while the polycrystalline state [18,19,30] has received little attention. It is expected that the creep of polycrystalline zinc would be satisfactorily explained by one of the recognized
creep theories that are available. The objective of the present investigation is to study the creep properties of polycrystalline zinc, in order to determine which theoretical model best fits the creep behavior for large grain sizes. The grain sizes in this investigation are larger than the range in which the material behaves in a superplastic manner, Since this investigation is concerned with the deformation of zinc occurring under conditions of steady state creep, a review of applicable deformation theories found In the
2
￼literature is in order.
Review of Theories of Steady State Creep Classification of Specimens
With respect to the crystal size, Figure 1 shows the spectrum of possible states into which a specimen of metal may be classified. This classification scheme makes use of the assumption that the specimen has a circular cross section, i. e., in the form of wire or rod. For purposes of this investigation, it is necessary to consider those creep theories which are applicable to the so-called "bamboo'1 and coarse-grain specimens.
Consider the cylindrical specimen in the diagram of Figure 2, which represents a test specimen with large crystals stacked end to end. The ratio of the grain diameter to the specimen diameter is
equal to one, and the crystals are equally spaced along the length of the specimen. This represents a specimen with the bamboo structure. Several creep theories are available to explain the plastic deformation of such a specimen.

The basis for equation (l) is that any crystal can, through
self-diffusion, change its shape and cause the polycrystalline aggregate to deform in a viscous manner. In the presence of an applied

￼stress, diffusional currents are established, as is shown in the diagram of Figure 3. This results in the diffusion of matter
away from grain boundaries where there is a normal compressive stress, and toward boundaries where there is a normal tensile stress. Crystalline flow is thus accomplished by the diffusion of atoms through the lattice, with the diffusion of vacancies forming a counterflow.

Additional assumptions are that the surface of the crystal is the source and sink for the vacancy gradient, the temperature must be sufficiently high such that the self-diffusion mechanism is activated, and the specimen is in an equiaxed, polycrystalline condition.

G-ilman-Weertman Theory
Since the bamboo structured specimen is essentially a series
of single crystals of different orientations stacked end to end, it
is likely that whatever mechanism dominates the deformation of single crystals may also dominate the bamboo structure. The high purity zinc
monocrystal experiments of Coffin and Weinan [15]? Weinberg [16],
6
￼Miller [17] ? Gilman [1^-], and Ccttrell [lS] are worth examining in this respect.
The main phenomenon pointed out in these investigations is the effect of crystal orientation. The strain rate changes greatly depending on how the "c" axis (zinc has a hexagonal close packed lattice structure) is oriented with respect to the tensile axis. Zinc is an unusual metal in that at low temperatures slip can only occur on the basal plane ((OOOl) plane), whereas at elevated temper- atures zinc is also capable of deforming through prismatic glide on the (lOlO) plane [1^4-] . Deformation will occur when the critical resolved shear stress on one of these two planes is reached.
Gilman reports that at elevated temperatures, prismatic glide will be the controlling deformation mechanism rather than slip occurring along the basal plane [lU]. He suggests the following
equation
where
c

where N is the fractional length of properly oriented crystals. At temperatures near half of the melting temperature, where the dominant mechanism may be basal or prismatic slip, the exponent of the steady state creep rate may change. Equation (5) can be generalized to account for this condition. Thus
,c = ^ij/m (6) where m is a temperature dependent constant. Equation (6) is not a
function of the grain size, whereas equation (3) is.
A further investigation of the theory "which explains the
deformation of a single crystal is in order, since | from equation ss
(6) lacks satisfactory definition. Crystallographic slip is generally agreed to be a phenomenon caused by dislocation movement. McLean [25] characterized the movement of a dislocation through a pure metallic crystal by the diagram of Figure k. For zinc, slip is the movement
of dislocations in planes parallel to the basa.l plane. The climb
of dislocations, or movement perpendicular to the glide plane, is
the recovery process. (Recovery is the modification of mechanical properties of a metal and is generally considered to be the reverse of strain hardening.)
￼Dislocations can be the result of crystalline imperfections, gain boundary irregularities, or can be generated under an applied stress through operation of Frank-Read sources, Weertman mechanisms
[_3k~\, etc. They move through the lattice impeded only by stress

fields of other dislocations, boundaries, and impurities [^0] . The crystal will experience a decrease in deformation rate when dislocations no longer move because of annihilation (eg., uniting of two screw dislocations of opposite sign), or dislocation pile up and immobilization
by some obstacle. This is the work hardening process. Steady state creep occurs when the work hardening of the material is completely
9
￼balanced by recovery.
Weertman [25] has suggested a mechanism to explain the gliding
and climb of dislocations as is applicable to single crystal deformation. His analysis assumes that dislocations are created at Frank-Read sources and move at a rate governed by the force exerted on the crystal. The analysis resultes in the creep rate equation
where

b = Burgers vector length |j, = shear modulus
A = temperature dependent constant
B = pJb2/2tT(l - v) .
Equation (7) satisfies the third power stress dependence observed
by Gilman [1^-] (equation (4)). Weertman [26] also proposed another analysis. In it he assumes that the rate controlling mechanism is
the frictional resistance to motion that a dislocation must overcome, i. e., the Peierl's force. This yields an identical equation except
the exponent on the applied stress, &lt;?, is equal to 2.5 for low stresses. It can be seen that for a given material, WeertmanTs analyses show
that the creep rate is not dependent on the grain size.
The following table, Table 1, summarizes the preceeding discussion concerning the theories of creep which are applicable to describing the deformation of a specimen with a bamboo structure.

Nabarro Theory
The following discussion is concerned with those creep
theories which are applicable to specimens with a coarse-grain poly- crystalline structure.
Nabarro [26] has modified his original diffusional creep theory to include a material with large grains. Once again, the assumption of his vacancy diffusion model is that under an applied stress, atoms will flow to relieve the stress, and vacancies will form a counter- flow. In his revised theory the sources and sinks for the vacancy gradient are no longer the grain boundary, but are dislocations in the crystal (which is perhaps an oversight in Herring's development of generalized equation (3))« His original theory was developed for fine-grain materials, where the large grain boundary area was a sufficient source. In a coarse-grain material this is not the case.
11
￼Nabarro [27] proposes two theories based on the preceeding assumption. The first is for medium to high temperatures, where self-diffusion of atoms through the lattice is possible. The second is for lower temperatures where diffusion of atoms and vacancies occurs along grain boundaries. We need only consider the first case.

where C is a constant, Kosevich-Saralidze-Slezov Theory
Kosevich, et al. [28], have proposed a diffusion mechanism of
12
￼deformation similar to that of Nabarro [27], with quite different results. Once again, the sources and sinks of vacancies are dis- locations, and in particular, are prismatic dislocation loops within the grain. A prismatic dislocation loop is simply a loop containing
mostly edge dislocations whose slip planes intersect in parallel lines and thus form a prism or cylinder. In essence, the prismatic loop is a congregation of vacancies. The resulting creep rate equation can be written

The most striking feature of this theory is that the creep
rate is proportional to the square of the grain size. Generalizing equation (10),for a given material yields
where P is a constant. Coble Theory

ess - ^r^ (11)
In an effort to explain the creep observed in polycrystalline
13
￼alumina, Coble [29] bas proposed a theory, which is based on boundary diffusion rather than lattice diffusion, as in the theory of Nabarro- Herring. The theory is satisfied over a wide range of temperatures and stresses, whereas the Nabarro theory is best suited for high temperatures and low stresses. Coble suggests that boundary diffusion is rate controlling when grains are large.
The Coble theory is based on a model of the crystal that is equiaxed and spherical in shape. The driving force, as in the
theory of Nabarro-Herring [21],is a concentration gradient of vacancies
moving under an applied stress . Vacancies do not move through the lattice, but move only along the boundary, and the boundary imper- fections are the sinks and sources of vacancies. In addition to deformation by diffusion, Coble also proposes that the deformation rate can be increased by shear stress relaxation at boundaries under- going changes in shape. The result of the analysis is given by equation (12) and generalized for a given material in equation (13).

where R is a constant. Thus, for this theory, the steady state strain rate is inversely proportional to the cube of the grain size. Grain Boundary Sliding
Evidence of grain boundary sliding has been produced by metallograph!c examinations of pure polycrysta.lline zinc samples deformed at constant stress by Gottrel]. and Aytekin [18], and McLean and Farmer [30]. For fine grain specimens ( d — 0.25 mm.) tested at 150 C and stresses of approximately 1000 psi., it was found that the amount of deformation contributed to the total by grain boundary sliding was 77 percent and remained relatively constant throughout higher temperature ranges •
Stevens [32,33] points out that as grains become large and test temperatures drop below 0.5 T of a given metal, that grain
boundary sliding is no longer an important deformation mechanism. The value of the contribution of grain boundary sliding to the total deformation drops to about 10 percent for fine grain specimens and continues to diminish for large grain specimens according to the
expression
where
K = constant
iGB =KEX (14)
15
￼X = average displacement of a grain boundary
N = average number of grain boundaries per unit length. Where grains are large, the value of N is small and the amount of
strain that can be attributed to grain boundary sliding is minimized. Therefore, in coarse-grain specimens, grain boundary sliding is not a prominent deformation mechanism [32].
Dislocation Theory
Weertman [3^*35336] has proposed several theories based on dislocation movement which predict strain rates of polycrystalline materials tested under a variety of conditions. These are all based on dislocation climb being rate controlling. He states that for hexagonal close packed metals like zinc, dislocation climb may not be rate controlling, since dislocation gli.de takes place with com- parative ease (refer to discussion concerning equation (7)).
In the event that dislocation climb is rate controlling, the expression for the steady state creep rate is given by
where

Q, = activation energy of steady state creep n = c o n s t a n t , 3 &lt; n &lt; ^+
Equation (15) is independent of grain size.
The derivation of equation (15.) is based on the assumption
that the activation energy of steady state creep equals that of self-
16
￼diffusion. The values of these parameters are given by Dorn [37], and Cottrell and Aytekin [18], and can be compared in Table 2. At 120 C the value of the activation energy for steady state creep is much less than that of self-diffusion, and thus the mechanism described by equation (15) may not be operational. It would become operational at a much higher temperature.

Equation (7) has been modified by Weertman [3^-] to include the conditions of dislocation glide being rate controlling in a poly- crystalline specimen. He presents a strain rate equation similar to equation (15), which is also independent of grain size. Furthermore, Dorn [38] has suggested a relationship based on the movement of jogged screw dislocations, which is also independent of grain size.

Statement of the Problem and Attack
The purpose of this investigation is to determine how the creep
rate of high purity zinc depends on the grain size. As is shown in
18
￼the previously discussed theories of creep, if temperature and stress are held constant, the steady state strain rate depends solely on the grain size according to

A comparison between the experimental value of n and its theoretical values provides a basis for determination of the primary deformation mechanism.
The investigation is carried out in the following manner: (1) A constant stress creep apparatus is designed and
constructed.
(2) Specimens of high purity zinc with varying grain sizes are
tested on the apparatus, holding stress and temperature constant (20 C) . Deformation rate data is taken and analyzed.
(3) A microscopic evaluation of specimen microstructure before and after testing is done to verify the results of mechanical testing.
In addition, the effect of the number of crystals in the cross section of a specimen is to be investigated (bamboo as opposed to a coarse-grain polycrystalline specimen deformation) . This is
19
￼done by using two different sizes of specimens with different microstructures. It was expected that the effects of crystal orientation would appear in test results with bamboo specimens, whereas these effects would be negligible in a polycrystal aggregate. The grain size dependence of strain rate could thus change and a different deformation mechanism would be indicated.

￼CHAPTER II
EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS, MATERIAL, AND PROCEDURE
A creep machine was designed and constructed specifically for use in this investigation. The machine differs from the usual constant load type creep machines in that the load varys in such a manner that a constant stress is applied to the test specimen. The rationale behind constructing such a device was twofold. First, the theories
of deformation that are under investigation are described by equations in which stress is a variable. Since it was necessary to hold stress constant in the investigation, constant load cr variable stress creep machines would be inapplicable. Though for small elongations the condition of constant stress is approximated by the constant load
creep machine, Cottrell and Aytekin [18] report that for zinc, a small change in stress level can produce large changes in strain rate
(even for strains of less than 1 percent). An added feature of the constant stress creep machine is that it is the apparatus that is conveniently used for temperature activation studies and further investigations of creep associated phenomena.
Review of Constant Stress Creep Machines
There are several methods by which one may vary the load
input to a test specimen in tension such that constant stress is achieved. One way would be to employ a spring system in association with a constant load creep apparatus such that as a specimen elongates,
21
￼the load would be relieved by the spring system. The diagram of Figure 5 shows such a simple machine. The choice of the spring in
such a system, however, is rather difficult, and the construction of such a system is therefore not considered.
Andrade [20] proposed a second method, shown in the diagram of Figure 6. The sides of the load weight are hyperbolic and the weight is partially immersed in water. As the specimen extends, the load on the specimen decreases as the load weight is buo.yed by the water. Such a system was considered impractical for this investigation.
Andrade and Chalmers [20] described, a third constant stress creep machine. It is shown in the diagram of Figure 7« The load beam plates B and C are made such that the moment of the load about
A varies with the tilt of the beam inversely as the length of the specimen under test.
A. fourth method, described by Jackman [41], is. utilized in this investigation, because it has a greater versatility than any
of the other systems. Referring to Figure 8, it can be seen that as the specimen elongates, the moment of the load taken about the fulcrum of the lever decreases as the right angle loading beam
swings toward the fulcrum. The effective load applied to the specimen therefore decreases. The beam maintains constant stress because the decrease in the diameter of the specimen as it elongates during creep is offset by an accompanying decrease in load produced by the movement of the load arm. The length of the specimen, t , and L , L„, and L~ must be so chosen that the correct movement occurs. A derivation of

￼of the machine consists of two 2-inch diameter columns (2)-* mounted to a heavy steel base (l),and bolted to an inch thick steel top base (25). The left column has a rack gear mounted to it, which
facilitates movement of the cradles (3^?5) up and down the column by means of a rack and pinion gear system.
The cradles (33^5) hold the deformation measuring transducer (17) , specimen (7)3 and load cell (28), respectively.
The cradles are made in a massive box type construction, largely of 3/^-inch by l+-inch cold rolled steel plate. Each cradle is fitted with a brass brake for holding the cradle in position on the column.
The specimen (7) is held by means of grips fabricated from stainless steel, and is put into tension by means of a linkage, which is more easily seen in the schematic of Figure 12 and the
photograph of Figure 11. A diagram showing the details of the specimen grips is shown in Figure 13. A diametrical interference fit of .00^- inch was used to hold the specimen during creep testing.
The specimen extension linkages are made of l/^-inch diameter cold rolled steel. The universal joint (ll) and the ball and socket joint (8) are employed in the extension system to assure that the specimen is put in uniaxial tension. A balanced extension platform
(9) holding a micrometer head (10) along with the deformation measuring transducer (17) and its amplification and readout devices allow
monitoring and measurement of the deformation of the specimen. The -^Numbers in ( ) indicates parts of the machine as per Figure 10.

￼micrometer head is necessary since the zero position of the particular transducer that was used is in the middle of its 0.2 inch total travel. The zero point must be located at the beginning of each test using the micrometer head. The specimen is held beneath the specimen holding cradle by means of four threaded stain- less steel rods holding a one inch thick aluminum specimen mounting base (26), to which the specimen is fixed by means of a ball and socket joint. Completing the specimen extension linkage is a turn- buckle (12) for eliminating slack in the linkage and a set of knife edges and holders (l^-) .
There are two sets of knife edges in the total loading system. They are made of Rex MM tool steel hardened to 65 R . Knife edges are employed in the system at crucial bearing points to reduce friction. The bearing points are also lubricated with a light machine oil.
Since the load arm is to be balanced before a load is input to the test specimen, the arm is fitted with counter balance weights
(13). The weights can be adjusted such that the beam is in balance about the fulcrum (load arm knife edges (15)) and is also balanced across the centerline of the beam. The load arm itself is fabricated out of l/2-inch thick 202^;- aluminum plate. Aluminum was chosen as
the material for the load arm because it is light and strong. The
need for a light beam arises, since a heavier load arm would necessitate a more massive counterbalance system, and it is desirable to keep
the total mass of the system minimal such that load input sensitivity is maximized.
Of special note is the beam position scale (l8) and the
33
￼horizontal position mark (19) scribed on the load arm. The fact that the beam will produce constant stress is based on the assumption that beam movements are small and are about this centerline. Tests run to calibrate the machine show that the machine can operate as predicted by theory from a maximum displacement of ± 0.3 inches from
the horizontal position on the scale (refer to Calibration section) . The use of the scale and the beam support (l6) allow proper
positioning of the beam such that the machine will operate as designed.
Therearethreepositionsthattheload,weight(2k) canbe applied, as is noted in Table k (L„ assumes three different values). These positions are marked as numbers 21, 22, and 23 on Figure 10. The rod holding the weight extends on both sides of the load arm
and is designed to hold Instron Tensile Test Machine calibration weights. Weight is to be uniformly applied across the beam so as
to avoid creating a moment at the fulcrum knife edge (15).
The transducer employed in this investigation is the Daytronic
model DS-200 and has a linear range of ± 0.1 inch. It is a linear variable differential transformer type transducer with a movable
core which rests against the micrometer head in the specimen extension linkage. With this arrangement, as the specimen extends the relative displacement of the two specimen grips is detected by the transducer. This motion is translated into an electrical signal which is amplified
by a Daytronic model 300D Transducer Amplifier Indicator with a Type 73 Differential Transformer Plug-in-Unit. This transducer-amplifier system is capable of measuring a displacement of .00001 inch. In

a creep test, the output of the Daytronic amplifier was input to a Leeds and Northrup Speedomax H strip chart recorder. The chart operates at a constant five minutes per inch of chart. This slow chart record- ing speed was necessary as the duration of the creep tests was to be
at least two hours.
Testing of the Apparatus
A variety of tests were performed on the machine elements to
determine that they would function as designed. The machine was also calibrated for its three positions of operation and a series of tests run to determine that the machine would, in fact, act to reduce the load input to the test specimen at the necessary rate in order to produce constant stress.
The first test performed was a calibration of the transducer- amplifier-recorder system. An Instron Calibration Micrometer, reading accurately to 0.0001 inch was used to mechanically simulate a displacement, from which the rest of the elements were calibrated. This calibration test showed that the displacement measuring system
has a sensitivity of 0.00001 inch. Recalibration of the system was also performed at the start of each day of testing to assure proper operation of these elements.
A test was performed to test for creep of the specimen extension linkages. A dummy specimen was fabricated from cold rolled steel,
the same material as the linkages are made from. This was inserted into the system using the specimen grips and linkages, and then put
35
￼under a stress of approximately 3000 psi . (ko lbs. input). The displacement measuring system was used to detect any movement or creep in the linkages. An elastic deflection of linkage elements was observed but no creep of the linkage elements was observed over a two hour period .
A test was performed to check for cradle movement. The cradles were braked properly, then subjected to severe hammering, which resulted in no cradle movement.
The creep tests were to cover, at a maximum, 0.2 inch of specimen extension as is allowed by the transducer operation range. It was necessary to determine if the machine would produce a constant stress over this extension range. The derivation in Appendix II shows that for small extensions of a specimen undergoing uniform elongation, that in order to maintain a constant stress, the load must decrease linearly. The rate of decrease is given by
where
P = the load
pih
\ -H£ &lt;")
K, = specimen length .
The subscripts indicate two points in time during the creep test. It isseenthattheratioofb-./t* dictateshowtheloadmustdecrease.
From this it was calculated that the linear reduction in load for a three inch gauge length specimen is 3-3 percent and for a two
36
￼inch gauge length specimen, it is k .8 percent, for a 0.1 inch extension.
In order to check to see if the machine was operating in this manner, an Instron D type cell (28) was connected to the extension system and a simulated specimen extension was conducted for the three load placement positions, while monitoring the load on the specimen and inputting 10 pounds on the load arm. The results can be found in Table 5, and the proper linearity seen in the graphs of Figures I*-!-, 15, and 16.
In each case the load decreases linearly for beam positions of approximately ±0.3 inches from the horizontal, which exceed the necessary beam position for a 0.2 inch specimen elongation. The percent decrease in load was calculated to be 3«7 percent, U.O percent, and ^.3 percent for positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively, Therefore,
the maximum error induced by the machine is a 0.8 percent error in load input for a maximum specimen extension of 0.2 inch. The agreement between predicted and experimental load decrease is good and the machine was therefore determined to be in satisfactory operating order.
Since the starting point for all creep tests was determined to be at the 0.3 mark on the beam indication scale from the preceeding test, it was necessary to determine what load input at the three loading positions would produce what load output on the test specimen.
Again, the Instron D Load Cell was used to determine this experimentally, by employing it in the extension system as before.

High purity zinc has a number of advantages over
that could have been used in this investigation. It is superplastic metal that creeps and exhibits extended plasticity at room temperature. Since the use of coarse-grain specimens was
necessary, zinc is an excellent metal to use because crystals are easily grown by the strain-anneal method to a larger size. Zinc also creeps at low stresses thus allowing larger diameter wires to be tested without applying excessive loads.
The zinc was received in the form of 12 inch long, 3/8-inch diameter cast rods. The microstructure of the material as received can be seen in the photograph of Figure 2k. The surface impurities were removed from the rods using ^-00 grit abrasive paper followed by macroetching in a solution of 50 percent nitric acid (HNO^) and distilled water. The rods were then swaged down to the desired diameter (refer to individual tests). The microstructure of the swaged material can be seen in the photograph of Figure 25 . After

￼swaging, the surface impurities were again removed using U00 grit abrasive paper, polishing paper, and another dip in the macroetching solution.
Heat treating of the specimens for stress relief and crystal growth was necessary. This was done by first putting the specimens in glass capsules to minimize surface oxidation. Evacuation of the capsules and purging the capsules with argon proved useless in this respect, as the specimens tended to sublime under these conditions. The specimens were then placed in a temperature controlled furnace and held at 750 F ± 25 F for the required length of time. Stress relief of the specimens takes approximately two minutes. Crystal growth takes anywhere from two minutes up to 2^1- hours, depending upon the size of the crystal required. After removal from the furnace, the glass encapsulated specimens were air cooled, and after cooling the specimens were again macroetched, this time using 50 percent hydrochloric acid and distilled water. The specimens were then stored at room temperature.
Testing Procedure
After the transducer measuring system was calibrated testing
could proceed. Test specimens were inserted into the specimen grips, which were held in a special jig. This was to avoid any possible bending of the specimen and tc assure a consistent three inch gauge length. Position 1 was used in all tests. With the specimen in the grips and jig, the grips were placed in the apparatus. After removing the slack in the linkages, the jig was removed and the
^6
￼specimen put into tension by applying the load. Loads used were Instron calibration weights. Details about the types of specimens and stresses used in each test can be found in the following sections concerning tests A, B, and C, and tensile testing. Graphs of specimen elongation versus time were produced from the transducer- amplifier-recorder system and used in the data analysis.
The length of each test is at least two hours in duration.
It was established that the creep of zinc reaches the steady state
condition after approximately one hour, as the value of the strain
rate based on successive time increments after one hour produces a
negligible change. In all cases, values of the steady state strain
rate (e ) given in the results are based on the last 30 minutes of N&amp;ss
testing.
Measurement of the average grain size of each specimen that
was tested is required. This is accomplished by the grain boundary intercept method, with measurements taken along the longitudinal
axis of the specimen. That is, the number of grain boundaries intercepted by a line one inch long, taken at four randomly chosen places on the specimen are counted. The mean grain intercept or average grain size is then found by dividing the length of the line by the number of intersections counted, and averaging the four values.
All testing is done at 20 C (room temperature) which is 0.^4-2 T
/ for zinc, and temperature is held constant in each test.

￼CHAPTER III
RESULTS
The results of this investigation include creep test data showing steady state strain rate dependence on grain size for the two specimen types tested, and a microscopic evaluation of specimens
before and after testing. Also, data from tensile tests have been obtained in order to determine a yield point for the material used in the investigation, as well as the extent to which specimens could be strained.
Tensile Testing
The tensile properties of pure zinc in the polycrystalline
and bamboo states were obtained using a standard Instron Tensile Tester. There were two reasons for determining these properties. First, it was necessary to determine a bound to the stress to be used in creep testing, such that it was sensibly near or below the yield stresses of the material. Second, it was of value to know what extensions could be expected from the specimens.
The results of the tensile tests are presented in Table 7. From the results of tensile testing it was established that the yield point for bamboo specimens, over the range of average grain
sizes, remained relatively constant at approximately 300 psi. Extensions of up to tyk percent were observed in specimens with a large

￼average grain size, whereas this value drops significantly to 20 percent to 30 percent as the grain size decreases. The yield of polycrystalline specimens is reported at approximately 12,000 psi., with extensions of 30 percent to ho percent attained.
From this data stresses of 236 psi. and 538 psi. were chosen for two creep tests on bamboo specimens . For a polycrystalline test, a stress of 8l8 psi. was chosen.
Creep Testsi on Bamboo Specimens
The first creep test, Test A, was conducted on 15 bamboo
structured specimens, with a diameter of .0695 inches, at a stress of 236 psi. A typical curve that was generated during the testing is given in Figure 20. Regions of transient and steady state creep
are noted. The transition from transient to steady state creep occurred after approximately one hour . Tests were two hours in length and values of steady state strain rate were computed as described in the test procedure section. The results of Test A are given in Table 8 and are represented graphically in Figure 21.
There is a great deal of scatter in the data of Test A.
The correlation coefficient produced by a least squares analysis of the data is 0.153. Consequently, drawing a curve through the data points is not meaningful.
Test B results are given in Table 9 and the graph of Figure 22 . The scatter in the data remains, and a correlation coefficient of O.llU was produced. It is noted that the strain rate of Test B increased by approximately a factor of 10 when compared with Test A.

￼An increase in strain rate with increasing stress is expected, according to all creep theories .
According to the theory of Herring (refer to Table l), the graphs of the data for Tests A and B should produce a straight line. This line is plotted for reference purposes on Figure 22. Once again, a linear regression analysis of the data of these tests shows a low correlation to a straight line.
Creep Tests on Coarse-Grain Polycrystallinei Specimens
Test C was performed on coarse-grain polycrystalline specimens
with a diameter of 0.2.5 inch, and at a stress of 8l8 psi . The results of creep tests on 12 specimens is given in Table 10, and are illustrated in the graph of Figure 23.
A linear regression of the data of Test C was performed using
a least squares analysis. The results of the analysis are as follows:
Correlation Coefficient: C.812/1.00 Intercept of the Line: 2.37 x 10 /min. Slope of the Line: -.6^5 x 10
The high correlation coefficient indicates that the straight line has a high correlation to test results.
The exponent of the grain, size, according to this analysis is +1.0, and thus differs from all creep theory equations listed in Table 3- A graph of the theoretical results according to the Nabarro-

Experimental Result
￼Microscopic Investigation of Specimens
A microscopic study of specimens before and after testing was performed to determine if some observable change in specimen
microstructure had taken place. The results are documented in the photographs of Figures ?-h through 30.
Figure 2^4- is a photograph of the high purity zinc material as received and before any fabrication of specimens was done. It was received in the form of cast rods, and therefore the microstructure shows the typical columnar grain structure.
The photograph on Figure 25 shows the microstructure of a typical specimen after swaging. The picture is the cross section of a .25 inch diameter specimen. The microstructure of a 0.0695 inch
diameter specimen shows a similar structure, but the grains are about half as large. The grains appear irregular and are in an unstable
condition (i. e., has not been annealed to its more stable structure). All specimens were annealed and heat treated as described in
Chapter II to allow crystal growth and to relieve residual stresses. Figures 26 and 2'7 show microstructures of typical bamboo specimens and coarse-grain polycrystalline speci.mens, respectively. Figure 26
shows the segmentation that is required in a bamboo type specimen; crystals of approximately equal size, but different orientations,
are stacked end to end. The photograph of Figure 27 shows the
cross section of a 0.25 inch diameter specimen. The number of crystals in the cross section of such specimens varied between five and approximately 300. The grains have a structure that is stable and

The curious change in macroscopic appearance of bamboo
specimens strained to fracture in tensile testing is shown in the photograph of Figure 28A. The specimen is seen to have areas where kinking and bending has occurred. In areas of highest strain, rotation of the slip plane has occurred to such an extent that the specimen has flattened out. Clam shell markings were observed on the surface of the specimen in these areas.
Figure 28B shows a bamboo specimen after a creep test. Of special interest in the photograph is an area that has necked sufficiently to cause a significant reduction in the cross sectional area. The necking was of the same nature as was observed in tensile test specimens after small elongations.
The photograph of Figure 29 was ma.de to investigate this necked area further. The photograph is of the surface of a bamboo specimen taken at a higher magnification than Figure 28B. The axis of tension in the picture is vertical. Noted are the markings of twinning or slip of the crystal (the full area of the photograph is a single crystal). These are identical markings as was observed by Elam [20] and Miller [17] in their experiments with zinc single
crystals. It is concluded that a large part of the total deformation of the crystals in a bamboo specimen is due to slip and twinning, as these markings were observable in all cases where necking was seen.
Microscopic examination of several cross sections of coarse- grain polycrystalline specimens showed similar marks as was observed

￼CHAPTER IV
DISCUSSION
Bamboo Specimens
Referring to the results of creep tests on bamboo specimens
(Tests A and B), the data show a great deal of scatter, and apparently the linear dependence of strain rate upon grain size as suggested
by Herring, is inapplicable (refer to Figure 22). It should be
noted that in the areas of the specimens where necking is observed, constant stress is not maintained and, in fact, are areas of locally higher stresses. The presence of slip or twinning marks in the necked areas indicates that the crystals in these areas are favorably oriented such that the critical resolved shear stress on the basal plane is reached, and therefore, the activation of the dislocation movements causing the deformation occurs in these areas first. The deformation of bamboo specimens may be viewed in terms of a "weakest link in a chain" analogy. The weakest links in the bamboo specimen are those crystals favorably oriented for slip and twinning to occur with relative ease compared with other crystals of different orientations. The deformation of the specimen is occurring mainly
in these necked areas, and not uniformly throughout the specimen.
Coarse-Grain Polycrystalline Specimens
The data collected on the creep of zinc specimens in the
69
￼coarse-grain polycrystalline state requires a different analysis.
No necking of the specimens is observed and the stress remains constant throughout the testing. Since all the crystals in the cross section of a specimen do not show the slip and twinning marks
noted in the photograph of Figure 30, the unmarked crystals are those crystals in which the critical resolved shear stress is not reached. Therefore, while slip or twinning are definitely mechanisms of deformation, they are only two of the several that may be contributing to the total deformation of any crystal in the specimen.
Another possible deformation mechanism is vacancy diffusion. However, the diffusion theories of Wabarro, Coble, and Kosevich,
et al. (refer to Table 3 ) , do not predict the linear grain size dependence of strain rate that was established in Creep Test C. The mechanisms described by these theories, then, are not correctly describing the deformation of zinc in the coarse-grain polycrystalline state .
70
￼CHAPTER V
CONCLUSIONS
Based on the results of this investigation into the creep of high purity zinc, the following conclusions car., be made:
(1) Bamboo structured specimens deform mainly through slip and twinning of favorably oriented crystals.
(2) Because of the effects of crystal orientation, bamboo specimens demonstrate an indeterminate relationship between grain size and steady s"Gate rate .
(3) With respect to coarse-grain polycrystalline specimens, a linear relationship (n = 1.0) between steady state strain rate and grain size is established, when stress and temiperature are constant.
(k) In coarse-grain polycrystalline specimens, deformation through slip or twinning occurs in only some of the crystals of the aggregate.
(5) The data collected on the dependence of strain rate upon grain size for coarse-grain polycrystalline specimens does not agree with any of the common creep theories.
71
￼CHAPTER VI
RECOMMENDATIONS
Clearly, the grain size dependence of strain rate alone will not necessarily indicate which mechanisms are operating during deformation. All theories of creep indicate the stress and temperature dependencies of strain rate . Temperature dependence of strain rate could give the best indication of what mechanisms are operating by satisfactorily determining such quantities as activation energies for lattice and boundary self-diffusion. The stress dependence of strain rate also provides a means of determining deformation characteristics, since the grain size can be held constant and the stress varied in a creep test. In any case, a microscopic evaluation of test materials provides invaluable information concerning deformation.
If any future investigations into deformation mechanisms are undertaken, the best hope for deciding which creep mechanism is dominating the deformation under a particular set of circumstances, through mechanical testing, lies in examining each of the variables, namely a temperature, stress, grain size, and specimen microstructure.

Thayer School of Engineering Dartmouth College“The impact of microstructure and physical properties on pore close-off at WAIS Divide and Megadunes”Stephanie Ann Gregory Master of ScienceDr. Mary Albert Dr. Ian Baker Dr. Zoe CourvilleAbstractThe depth at which atmospheric air becomes entrapped into bubbles at the bottom of the firn column plays an important role in creating an appropriate age difference (Δage) between the age of the gas and the age of the ice at a given depth within an ice core. The top 50-120m of an ice sheet consists of polar firn, a porous media, acting as a filter smoothing atmospheric signals as air rapidly diffuses to the base of the firn column on a decadal time scale. The density, permeability and microstructure of two firn cores from different local climates, WAIS Divide and Megadunes, were examined. The microstructure of the firn was determined to have a greater impact on permeability and pore close-off than density had.Comparison between sites show that, at a given density, the pore structure of Megadunes firn was less complex and tortuous with greater permeability than WAIS Divide firn, characterized by smaller grains and a more complex pore structure. For both WAIS Divide and Megadunes, fine grained layers experience close-off shallower in the firn column than do coarse grained layers, regardless of which grain sized layer is thei v   
more dense layer at depth. Pore close-off occurs at an open porosity that is accumulation rate dependent. Low accumulation sites, with coarser grains, close-off at lower open porosities (&lt;10%) than the open porosity (&gt;10%) of high accumulation sites with finer grains. The greater the variability between fine grained and coarse grain firn layers at depth, the longer the lock-in zone will be. At Megadunes, the fine grained layers are remnants of past accumulation sites on the ice sheet surface. These layers reach pore close-off significantly shallower than densification models predict for polar sites with similar local climate. A shallow LID would decrease Δage to values similar to those predicted through δ15N reconstructions of firn thickness. Application of this work in future studies could reduce the data-model mismatch, improve modeling of the lock-in zone through firn densification models, and reduce the need for inverse firn air modeling.v

1 IntroductionWhen snow accumulates on land in very cold areas of the polar regions, where it never melts, it will gradually build up over time creating vast ice sheets that are able to store past climate signals in both the ice and the trapped air bubbles. To properly reconstruct and interpret climatic conditions of Earth’s past, it is first necessary to understand how these signals are recorded. Of vital importance is the process in which polar firn, the porous stage between snow and ice, acts as a filter on atmospheric signals. At a given depth in an ice core, the air trapped within the ice matrix will always be younger than the ice due to the porous nature of the firn and the ability for atmospheric air to diffuse quickly to the base of the firn column. This age difference, commonly referred to as the gas age/ice age difference (Δage), holds the key to understanding the phasing between climate signals such as temperature, reconstructed from the ice phase, and carbon dioxide concentrations, reconstructed from the gaseous phase. It is important to understand how current local climate influences the microstructure of the firn, the gas transport properties through the firn column, and at what depth and density pore close-off takes place. Knowledge of firn behavior under present climate conditions will enable better modeling of how the firn evolved and trapped air in the past; specifically during glacial periods and glacial-interglacial transitions.Firn, characterized by its complex porous layered nature, consists of multiyear snow compacting and sintering due to overburden pressure. Densification and compaction of the firn continues until pores are sealed off from one another as bubbles by the surrounding ice. Due to the porous nature of the firn atmospheric air can diffuse to the base of the firn column on a decadal time scale (Schwander et al., 1997, Sowers et al.,1   
1992, Bender et al., 1997, Severinghaus et al., 2001, Kaspers et al., 2004). As the porosity of firn decreases with depth the controlling gas transport mechanisms also change (Sowers et al., 1992). Near the surface of the ice sheet, where firn is very porous convection is possible through wind pumping. Below the convective zone is the diffusive zone where molecular diffusion dominants gas transport. As the firn increases in density and pores become smaller and more segregated horizontal impermeable layers start to form initiating the lock-in zone. Within the lock-in zone, the air ages at the same rate as the surrounding ice and advection is the main transport mechanism. The length and presence of each of these zones varies from site to site depending on the local climate. This site to site variability and resulting microstructure differences that dictate gas transport and bubble entrapment in polar firn are not well understood. Due to this lack of knowledge, firn air models and firn densification models are calibrated to present day climate conditions and have a finite range under which they will produce accurate results. In order to extrapolate these models, beyond present day conditions, to extreme conditions found in glacial periods, the role of firn microstructure on pore close-off must be better understood.This thesis focuses on the process of pore close-off and the evolution of microstructure in deep firn at two Antarctic sites, WAIS Divide and Megadunes. WAIS Divide was chosen because it is the current U.S. deep drilling location for the ice coring community, hence findings could have immediate impact on ice core interpretation. WAIS Divide has high snow accumulation and does not experience snow melt; its local climate conditions are similar to those at Summit, Greenland, where the GISP2 ice core was drilled. The Megadunes site captures an extreme end of present day climate2   
conditions due to its very low accumulation rate, cold temperatures, and high winds (Severinghaus et al., 2010). Stratigraphy, bulk density, and permeability measurements are done in conjunction with x-ray computed tomography to better understand the relationships between grain size, density, permeability, and pore structure. The overarching goals of this thesis are to1. Characterize the lock-in zone at WAIS Divide and Megadunes2. Understand how the physical signature of antidunes propagate down the firncolumn3. Relate bulk properties to microstructure characteristics in deep firn4. Provide insight into how local accumulation and temperature effects pore close-off3   
2 Background2.1 Pore Close-off 2.1.1 The Lock-in ZoneSometimes referred to as the non-diffusive zone, the lock-in zone (LIZ) exists at the bottom of the firn column ending at the firn-ice transition. The lock-in depth (LID), the depth at which the first horizontal impermeable layers of firn impede gas transport with the overlying atmosphere, marks the beginning of the lock-in zone. The close-off depth (COD), the depth where all pores are closed in both the horizontal and vertical directions, marks the end of the lock-in zone.Figure 1. Schematic of an ice core. Note: Not to scale due to emphasis on the firn column including gas transport zones and important lock-in zone definitions.￼4   
As air ages at approximately the same rate as the surrounding ice matrix below the LID, the LID is critical for determining (Δage). In addition, the length of the lock-in zone, is important for understanding the age spread of air trapped within bubbles at a given depth. While a small volume percentage of pores close above the lock-in zone the bulk of pore close-off happens between the LID and the COD.2.1.2 Parameters Influencing of Pore Close-offThe depth of the LID and the length of the LIZ vary from site to site depending on local climate. Typically warm temperatures correspond to a shallow LID while cold temperatures lead to a deeper LID. Accumulation rate tends to have a direct relationship with LID depth where an increase in accumulation rate results in a deeper LID (Landais et al., 2006). Accumulation rate also influences the length and presence of the LIZ. According to Landais et al., (2006), an increase in accumulation rate will lead to an increase in the length of the LIZ.5   
￼Figure 2. Diagram of firn from a high accumulation site with a high degree of layering (left) and low accumulation site with little to no layering (right) from Landais et al. (2006).The assumption in the study by Landais et al. (2006) is that density variability associated with higher accumulation rates due to differences in winter and summer snow deposition is thought to propagate down the firn column and these layers will achieve pore close-off at different depths due to density variability, figure 2. To further understand the role of surface density variability and density variability at depth, Horhold et al. (2011) examined 16 high resolution density profiles of both Arctic and Antarctic firn. For all sites, a minimum in density variability was found at ~0.60-0.65 g⋅cm-3 beyond which the variability increased again with depth until reaching a second minimum beyond the firn- ice transition. An inverse relationship was found where high accumulation rate leads to less density variability at the surface of the firn but greater variability at LIZ depths. Low6   
accumulation rates lead to higher density variability in surface firn but low variability at LIZ depths. The findings by Horhold et al. (2011) support those by Landais et al. (2006) in which low accumulation sites tend to have small to no lock-in zone while high accumulation sites have large lock-in zones.2.1.3 Firn Densification Models and Pore Close-offThe ability to accurately reconstruct past close-off depths based on temperature and accumulation rate of a site is necessary for constraining Δage. The Herron and Langway (1980) model examined density profiles of 17 polar sites covering both high and low accumulation rates from Greenland and Antarctica. The Herron and Langway model is commonly used to approximate the density profile of a given site but it does not account for the layered nature of the firn. A second model was developed by Martinerie et al. (1992), in which the mean pore close-off density is calculated based solely on the average temperature of a given site. Other studies have been done to better parameterize firn densification to include heat diffusion (Goujon et al., 2003) and the layered nature of the firn (Mitchell et al., 2013). Currently, the LID is characterized as the first layers of firn to reach a site specific pore close-off density that ranges between 13% and 21% total porosity depending on temperature and accumulation rate (Goujon et al., 2003). Firn densification models by Herron and Langway (1980), Barnola et al. (1991), Arnaud et al. (2000), and Goujon et al. (2003), are either entirely empirical or semi-empirical with calibrations dependent upon current climate condition of polar ice coring sites. These models also assume steady-state firn densification. While the firn densification models work reasonably well at predicting present day lock-in depths (LID), they produce large7   
uncertainties outside of their calibration range (Landais et al., 2006, Severinghaus et al., 2010). No densification model accounts for the porosity cross-over and how firn microstructure at depth may influence pore close-off.2.2 Densification of FirnWhile the firn column can be divided into zones based on the dominating gas transport mechanisms it can also be divided into sections based on the dominating densification mechanisms. Traditionally critical densities have been designated at 0.55 g⋅cm-3 and 0.83 g⋅cm-3 (Herron and Langway, 1980, Barnola et al., 1991). At densitiesabove 0.55 g⋅cm-3 the major mechanism of densification is particle rearrangement and grain settlement (Herron and Langway, 1980). Between 0.55 g⋅cm-3 and 0.83 g⋅cm-3 the densification rate is slower and driven by a variety sintering mechanism. At densities greater than 0.83 g⋅cm-3 bubble compression drives densification until the maximum density of glacial ice is reached of ~0.91 g⋅cm-3.Snow deposition on the surface of an ice sheet will quickly undergo destructive metamorphism; where snowflake structure becomes more rounded and spherical (Colbeck, 1983). After this process the densification slows and temperature gradient induced vapor transport causes grain coarsening in the upper meters of the firn column. The lower the accumulation rate, the longer the residence time, the coarser the grains will become (Albert et al., 2004). In general, an increase in temperature will cause an increase in the rate of vapor transport while a decrease in temperature will slow vapor transport, the larger the temperature gradient, the quicker firn will metamorphisize (Alley, 1988). While grains are coarsening due to thermal gradients they are also settling8   
￼and compacting. At a density of 0.55 g⋅cm-3 the grains are thought to have reached their maximum packing arrangement (Herron and Langway, 1980).Sintering of firn grains involves multiple mechanisms, figure 3, including three from surface sources; surface diffusion, lattice diffusion, vapor diffusion, two from grain boundary sources; grain boundary diffusion and lattice diffusion, and one from a dislocation source; lattice diffusion (Swinkels and Ashby, 1980).￼Figure 2: Representation of the six major mechanisms for sintering (above) and theFigure 3. Mechanisms leading to sintering in polar firn (Chen 2008).routes for mass transport. Figure from Chen 2008.At densities between 0.55 g⋅cm-3 and 0.83 g⋅cm-3 the dominating mechanism for sintering is unclear and Freitag et al. (2004) postulated that the mechanisms act differently on fine grained and coarse grained layers.A complicating factor of firn densification is the layered nature of polar firnwhere high and low density layers exist in close proximity to one another. This causes aFigure 3: Sintering resulting in densification with a decrease of center-to-center distance (uan)iqourenositdueantsioifnicwathioerne(ibn)d(iCvihdeunal2f0i0rn8)l.ayers will reach the above critical densities at avariety of depths.

Horhold et al. (2012) postulated that the minima and second variability maxima may be due to the presence of impurities, specifically calcium, in the firn, rather than grain size.2.3 Gas Transport in Porous Polar Firn2.3.1 Permeability and DiffusivitySimple relationships for permeability through porous media can also be applied to polar firn. Darcy’s Law can be used to either model permeability via Lattice Boltzmann techniques (Courville et al., 2010, Freitag et al., 2002) or it can be applied to directly measure the permeability of discrete firn samples (Albert et al., 2000, Rick and Albert, 2004, and Courville, 2007). Darcy’s Law is as follows:ν=(k/μ )*(dP/dx) (3) where k is the permeability constant, μ is the air viscosity, dP is the pressure differential,dx is the height of the sample and ν is the flow velocity. Freitag et al. (2002) found that permeability fits open porosity using a power law function with an exponent of 2.1.Permeability of polar firn has a large influence on whether or not a specific site will have a convective zone, and if a convective zone is present how deep it will penetrate into the firn column. Courville et al. (2007) correlated the large convective zone at Megadunes, Antarctica to high permeability in the surface firn. A current study by Adolph et al. (in progress) has shown a linear relationship exists between diffusivity and permeability in deep firn, including the lock-in zone, but a decoupling in the1 1   
transport properties exist at high open porosities towards the firn surface. Adolph et al. (in progress) also found that the power laws derived by Freitag et al. (2002) are not appropriate over the entire porosity range exhibited by polar firn when compared with direct measurements. A possibility for this mismatch may be due to firn samples originating from different sites in each study and microstructural difference may result in different gas transport properties at each site.Diffusion in a porous media including polar firn follows Fick’s Law:J(z,t) = -D*∂c(x,t)/ ∂z + c(z,t)*u (1) where J is the gas flux, z is the depth, t is the time, c is the mixing ratio, D is the diffusioncoefficent and u is the superficial gas velocity (where u=sop*v where sop is the open porosity and v is the flow rate of the carrier gas) (Fabre et al., 2000). To obtain the effective diffusivity of a gas within a connected porous structure the following relationship is given by (Dullien, 1975):D=s Do/τ (2) x op xWhere D is the effective diffusivity of gas x, D o is the free air molecular diffusion xxcoefficient and τ is the tortuosity of the pore structure. Several studies have directly measured the effective diffusivity of gases within the porous matrix of polar firn (Schwander et al., 1988, Fabre et al., 2000, Adolph and Albert, 2013). The method used to measure diffusivity on individual firn samples by Schwander et al., (1988) and Fabre et al. (2000) required the use of both a tracer gas and carrier gas. To obtain the gas diffusivity, measurements of an eluting peak of the tracer gas were made over a variety of flow rates and extrapolated to zero. After measuring gas diffusivities a relationship with total porosity was developed in which diffusivity drops to zero below 0.12 porosity but1 2   
shows no site to site variability. Fabre et al. (2000) found that measurements of diffusivity on discrete firn samples do not capture the entire diffusive behavior of the firn through forward modeling. Note that both studies parameterize the effective diffusivity and tortuosity of the firn with total porosity and give no indication as to how open versus closed porosity may influence the relationship.Adolph and Albert (2013) adapted techniques previously established for porous media, such as soil, to use on polar firn where diffusivity is measured directly using an inert tracer gas, SF6. The study applied a numerical solution for Fick’s second law of diffusion to calculate the diffusivity of the tracer gas. Further work by Adolph et al. (in progress) has shown promise in using direct diffusivity measurements on discrete samples in capturing the true diffusive behavior of polar firn at Summit, Greenland. Freitag et al. (2002) and Courville et al. (2010) applied Lattice Boltzman modeling for diffusion on three dimensional reconstructions of polar firn. Freitag et al. found that effective diffusivity followed open porosity in a power law function with an exponent of 3.4.Molecular diffusion in polar firn leads to gravitational and thermal fractionation of heavy isotopes and molecules. The dominating process in polar firn is gravitational fractionation enriching heavy isotopes towards the base of the firn column. Gravitational fraction follows the barometric equation and can be written:δgrav=exp[gzΔM/RT]-1x103 (4) Where δgrav is the enrichment of an isotope relative to atmospheric concentrations, g is thegravitational constant, z is the depth, ΔM is the mass difference, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature of the gas (Craig et al., 1988). While the effect is smaller,1 3   
thermal fractionation may play an important role during abrupt climate change when a larger temperature gradient exists in the firn column than exists under stable climate conditions (Severinghaus et al., 2001, Weiler et al., 2009).2.3.2 Firn Air MeasurementsAir existing in the open porosity of the firn column can be sampled strategically with depth as firn cores are drilled for a variety of reasons. While the firn air is typically only a few decades old at the base of the firn column, some recent anthropogenic changes in atmospheric gases such as mercury (Fain et al., 2008) can be seen and quantified. The major focus of firn air campaigns is understanding how firn can smooth and alter atmospheric signals before air is entrapped in bubbles and many studies throughout Antarctica and Greenland have been conducted (Clark et al., 2007, Buizert et al., 2011, Kawamura et al., 2006, Schwander et al., 1993, Witrant et al., 2011, Etheridge et al., 1996, Trudinger, 2001, Severinghaus et al., 2010, Severinghaus et al., 2001, Fabre et al., 2000, and Battle et al., 2011). A wide range of sites, with a variety of temperatures and accumulation rates, have been studied and were succinctly summarized by Buizert (2013) in the following table.1 4

one trace gas the solutions are not well constrained (Buizert et al., 2012). Recent studies by Buizert et al. (2012) and Witrant et al. (2011) use multiple tracer gases to better constrain the firn air models. While multiple tracers greatly improves inverse firn air models, inverse modeling is not possible for past firn columns where it is impossible to know what the firn air concentration profiles were.Firn air models are commonly used to find the age distribution of the air trapped at a given depth, to reconstruct recent atmospheric concentrations from firn air measurements, and to estimate the diffusive column height from δ15N measurements of deep ice cores. Constraining the age distribution at the base of the firn column establishes the resolution limit of atmospheric signals (Buizert et al., 2012, Schwander et al., 1993, Trudinger et al., 1997). Modeling of the age distribution is typically done on the air within the open pore space of the firn column but has also been done on the air trapped within the closed bubbles of deep polar firn (Mitchell et al., 2013). These models are also used on reconstructed firn columns of the past to estimate the smoothing that occurred in the atmospheric signals recorded in the bubbles of deep ice cores. Along with the age distribution at a given depth, modeling of firn air transport within modern firn columns enables the reconstruction of recent atmospheric concentration profiles for a variety of gases. Studies have been done to reconstruct a multitude of gas concentrations including carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, mercury, and carbon monoxide among others (Etheridge et al., 1996, Braunlich et al., 2001, Aydin et al., 2011, Fain et al., 2009, Assonov et al., 2007).Perhaps the most important application of firn air models is reconstruction of past diffusive column heights through δ15N measurements from deep ice coring records.1 7   
Modeled diffusive column height can be used to estimate the LID during past climatic conditions and consequently constrain the gas age/ice age difference. A short coming of estimating LID from just the diffusive column height is a lack of knowledge about the length of both the convective and diffusive zones (Schwander et al., 1997).2.4 Data-model MismatchAs atmospheric air diffuses through the firn, the firn acts as a filter on the air as the microstructure compacts and sinters, in effect causing the trapped air to always be younger than the surrounding ice. Determining the gas age/ice age difference (Δage) is highly dependent upon the local climate, specifically the accumulation rate and temperature, at the time of entrapment. Current firn densification models by Herron and Langway (1980), Barnola et al. (1991), Arnaud et al. (2000), and Goujon et al. (2003), are calibrated to be dependent upon current climate condition of polar ice coring sites. These models also assume steady-state firn densification. While the firn densification models work reasonably well at predicting present day lock-in depths (LID), they produce large uncertainties outside of their calibration range. The uncertainties lead to a data-model mismatch during glacial and glacial-interglacial transitions between the LID predicted with firn densification models and the LID reconstructed from air isotopic composition, δ15N measurements (Landais et al., 2006, Loulergue et al., 2007, Capron et al., 2012, Dryefus et al., 2010, and Parrenin et al., 2013). To properly address Δage accurately constraining both firn densification models and the use of δ15N as a proxy for LID is vital.1 8   
2.5 Microstructure of Polar FirnThe microstructure of polar firn influences both the densification and gas transport processes of firn. Original methods of microstructure characterization involved image analysis of two dimensional thin slices (Alley et al., 1982). While 2D reconstructions give a reasonable indication of pore structure, development of 3D imaging techniques fully captures the complex nature of polar firn. Three dimensional analysis has been done on firn cores through reconstruction of thin slices (Freitag et al., 2002) and microcomputed tomography. Although x-ray computed tomography is well established in soil science (Taina et al., 2008), initial application to polar firn has only happened in the last 10-15 years (e.g. Coleou et al., 2001; Freitag et al., 2004;; Schneebeli et al., 2004). A number of studies have been done using x-ray computed tomography to examine the microstructure of polar firn from the surface through the firn- ice transition. These studies have focused primarily on understanding how microstructure differences between fine grained and coarse grained firn influences the densification rate of polar firn (Freitag et al., 2004, Lomonaco et al., 2011, Fujita et al., 2009). Other studies include the influence of microstructure, either from thin sections or x-ray computed tomography on the permeability of firn at the top of the firn column (Albert et al., 2004, Courville et al., 2007, Rick and Albert, 2004).Fujita et al. (2009) focused on microstructure to understand how insolation influences the firn and how the insolation signal is expressed at depth. The study used bulk density measurements at 3mm resolution, 3D reconstructions of the pore space and the qualitative measure of permeability to characterize the firn. Fujita et al. (2009) found that initially high density layers were less dense than initially low density layers in deep1 9   
firn. The initially high density layers were also found to be more permeable at depth through qualitative measurements of permeability. They conclude that diffusion at the base of the firn column depends on the extent of summer insolation and subsequent alternation of microstructure characteristics at Dome Fuji (Fujita et al., 2009). Freitag et al. (2004) also follows the metamorphism of fine grained and coarse grained layers from the surface of the firn to the firn ice transition from core B27 drilled in Greenland. The study found that coarse grained layers densify at a quicker rate than fine grained layers, postulating that the sintering mechanisms involved in densification probably act differently on differently sized grains. Interestingly the pore size of both fine grained and coarse grained layers decreases at very similar rates at equivalent depths in the firn column. Quicker rates of densification in coarse grained firn leads to a porosity (or density) cross-over in which initially dense layers at the surface become the less dense layers in deep firn. This regime shift implies that pore close-off should occur first in fine grained firn layers if pore close-off is microstructure dependent (Freitag et al., 2004).Lomonaco et al. (2011) specifically addresses the fine grained firn layers at Summit, Greenland from the surface of the firn down to 90m just past the firn-ice transition. The study found that the majority of pores in fine grained layers close below 65m starting just above the LIZ defined through firn air measurements that starts at 69m. The microstructure of the fine grained layers decreased in structure model index, a measure of concavity/convexity of the ice structure, until a value of -9, indicative of ice surrounding spherical air bubbles (between 70-90m). Around 25-35m the structure model index becomes negative in response to the ice structure transforming from convexly shaped ice grains surrounded by air to a concavely shaped ice structure2 0   
surrounding the interstitial pore space. For both the Freitag et al. (2004) and Lomonaco et al. (2011) studies, permeability measurements were not done on the samples and thus knowledge of which layers, fine or coarse reach pore close-off first is unknown.In depth studies of how microstructure affects gas transport in the near surface of firn columns have been conducted by Albert et al. (2004), Rick and Albert, (2004), Courville et al. (2007), and Horhold et al. (2009). The major focus of these studies was to relate permeability measurements to microstructural characteristics developed through either two dimensional or three dimensional firn reconstructions. Albert et al. (2004) found a correlation between low density, coarse grained firn layers and an increase in permeability in the top meter of firn at Megadunes, Antarctica. Comparison with other polar sites showed that the unique hiatus sites found on the leeward face of the dunes consisting of very large coarse crystals caused much higher permeability values than those found at higher accumulation sites such as Summit, Greenland (24cm⋅a-1 w.e.) andSiple Dome, Antarctica (11cm⋅a-1 w.e.). Further examination of the top two meters of the firn at Megadunes, at both a hiatus and an accumulation site, were conducted by Courville et al. (2007). The microstructure at the accumulation site consisted of very fine grained wind pack with many wind crusts, in direct contrast to the microstructure at the hiatus site which consisted of large coarse grains. While density profiles of both locations were similar, with the hiatus site being slightly less dense at multiple depths, the permeability of the hiatus site was noticeably higher than the permeability at the accumulation site. This study provided a direct link between microstructure and gas transport in the surface firn at Megadunes which has been linked to the large convective zone that exists down to 23m at the Megadunes site.2 1   
Rick and Albert, (2004) also related microstructure characteristics to the permeability profiles of multiple shallow cores from the 2000 ITASE expedition. This study highlighted the impact of accumulation rate on permeability by showing a direct connection between an ENSO-induced accumulation rate change and a marked increase in permeability at depth where this event is currently located in the firn column. The increase in permeability corresponds to an increase in grain size of both summer and winter layers due to an increased residence time at the surface of the ice sheet.Another study done by Horhold et al. (2009) on near surface firn microstructure and permeability also found evidence for accumulation rate impacting the grain size of polar firn in the top 2.5m. The increase in grain size at the surface keeps an enduring signature as it is buried within the firn column. This enduring signature continues to affect gas transport at depth. It was found that the lower the accumulation rate, the longer the residence time in the upper 2.5m of firn, the larger the grains, the higher the permeability within the firn (Horhold et al., 2009). In general for all of the permeability studies done on near surface firn, permeability increases to a maximum around 2.5m depth as snow grains coarsen and then decreases as sintering and densification processes control firn metamorphism. Fluctuations and differences between sites in permeability profiles are likely due to changes in accumulation rate and other local climate signals. How microstructure continues to influence polar firn permeability down the firn column until complete pore close-off has not yet been established.2.6 Megadunes2 2   
￼F02030Figure 6. Diagram of an antidunes profile (Courville et al., 2007).They are characterized as long wavelength (2-5 km) and short amplitude (2-4 m) with accumulation occurring primarily on the windward dune face, accumulation sites, which can be covered in large sastrugi. As the leeward dune faces, hiatus sites, have little to zero accumulation they are sastrugi-free with extensive depth hoar (Frezzoti et al., 2002). From satellite imagery megadunes have been found to migrate upwind at 10 to 20 m⋅a-1 (Fahnestock et al., 2000).COURVILLE ET AL.: ACCUMULATION HIATUS IMPACTS ON FIRNFigure 1.

The ten measurements were generally within 3% of one another. In previous field tests of the permeameter, different snow samples from the same depositional layer typically had permeability values that agreed to within 10%.[10] The thermal conductivity was measured on firn coresin the laboratory using a needle probe that was inserted intoplaced in a thick, close-fitting block of insulation with a thermal conductivity similar to firn in order to insulate the samples. The probe was allowed to equilibrate with the snow sample in the test assembly for 40 min before each thermal conductivity test was run. Temperature recordings from the probe showed that thermal equilibrium had been reached before each measurement. Replicate thermal con- ductivity measurements on the same snow sample are generally within 5% of one another.[11] In addition to the snow pit samples, several shallow(2–12 m), hand-drilled firn cores were retrieved from eachsite 5 to 10 m from the pit locations and sent to the coldlaboratory at the Cold Regions Research and EngineeringLaboratory (CRREL) for further analysis.

Figure 7. MODIS visible-band image composite where accumulation faces appear bright (left-a) and Radarsat Antarctic C band backscatter image where accumulation faces appear dark (right-b) (Courville et al., 2007).The presence of Megadunes and their migration upwind slowly buries past dune faces that are preserved in the firn column. The presence of hiatus sites, with large coarse firn grains increases the permeability of the surface firn (Courville et al., 2007). The direct result of an increase in permeability, significantly higher than other present day firn sites, is deep convection.2.7 Site Characteristics2.7.1 MegadunesMeasurements of firn air and extraction of a firn core from a megadunes site in East Antarctica were accomplished at an undisturbed site in December 2004-January 2005 at 80.77914° S, 124.48796° E. Courville et al., 2007 thoroughly describes the site details and near-surface measurements, and Severinghaus et al 2010 describes firn air results.. The average temperature at the site is -49° C with an accumulation rate less than 4cm weq yr-1. In-situ firn air measurements at Megadunes done by Severinghaus et al. (2010) indicate a LIZ from 64.5m to 68.5m. The convective zone at Megadunes is notably very large reaching a depth of ~23m (Severinghaus et al., 2010).2 4   
￼Figure 8. Map of megadunes locations in Antarctica. The Megadunes site used for this study is in megadunes field closest to Vostok. http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/antarctica/megadunes/megadunes_camp.html2.7.2 WAIS DivideFirn core, WDC05C, was retrieved from a previously undisturbed site at 79.46300° S 112.12317° W near the WAIS Divide ice coring site for firn air measurements in December 2005-January 2006. (Battle et al., 2011). The mean annual temperature at the site is -31°C and the average accumulation rate is 22cm yr-1 ice- equivalent (Banta et al., 2008). The accumulation rate and average temperature at the site are both significantly higher than those at the Megadunes location. From in-situ firn air measurements done by Battle et al. (2011) a LIZ exists from approximately 66m to 76.54m. Similar to other high accumulation sites, the convective zone is small, likely ranging between 1.4m and 5.2m in depth (Battle et al., 2011).2 5

3 Methods3.1 Visual StratigraphyVisual stratigraphy was observed using a backlit light table in a cold room at the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory in Hanover, NH. Meter long core sections were placed on the light table where grain size and wind crusts were recorded to the 1 mm scale. Grain size was qualitatively described using a five tier scale from coarse to fine for each meter length section. Coarse and fine were defined relative to other layers within the meter long section. Samples of 5-10 cm of similar grain size were cut for further analysis. Emphasis was put on obtaining a single homogenous layer of firn per sample whenever possible, in order to facilitate comparisons of the properties with quantitative microscopy results.3.2 Bulk DensityBulk density measurements made on the same done 5-10 cm resolution samples using volumetric measurements and the mass of the sample.ρ =4*m /(π*d 2*h ) (5) sssswhere ρs is the density of the sample, ms the mass, ds the diameter, and hs the height. As a was slice taken from the Megadunes firn core for isotopic analysis, volumetric calculations were adjusted for the change in shape accordingly. Error in density measurements was small with less than 0.5% standard deviation for 10 repeat measurements on a single sample. Broken or chipped pieces were not reported in bulk density or permeability measurements.2 7   
3.3 Permeability3.3.1 Permeability of Firn SamplesPermeability measurements were made using the methods developed by Albert et al., 2000, and used for example in Rick and Albert, 2004, and Courville, 2007. Using a custom apparatus that had been verified on glass beads, air was drawn through a firn sample, and the associated flow rate and pressure drop across the sample were measured, along with temperature and barometric pressure. A variety of flow rates were employed. For each flow rate and associated pressure drop recorded, the permeability was obtained using Darcy’s law. Flow rates of air through the samples were kept within the laminar flow regime where Darcy’s Law holds true.ν=(k/μ )*(dP/dx) (6) where k is the permeability constant, μ is the air viscosity, dP is the pressure differential,dx is the height of the sample and ν is the flow velocity.Figure 10. Image of the model 2010 permeameter.￼2 8   
Before measurements were taken the permeameter was calibrated using glass bead samples until measured permeability of the glass beads was within the bounds of literature values on packed glass bead permeability. Ten measurements with ten different flow rates were done on each sample and usually fell within 5-10% of one another. At very low permeabilities fewer measurements were done on each sample due to the low flow rates needed to stay within the laminar flow regime and the range of the pressure transducer. During measurements, as permeability decreased and the differential pressure across the firn sample increased larger range pressure transducer of 15” and 30” were used. The minimum permeability measured on a firn sample with the 30” pressure transducer was 0.01x10-10m2 and all samples whose measurements fell below the range of the 30” pressure transducer range were considered impermeable for the purposes of this study.3.3.2 Calibration of the Permeameter with Glass BeadsCalibration was done on the 2010 and 700 model permeameters through glass bead testing. Three glass bead samples of 0.75mm, 1mm and 3mm diameter beads were assembled. Assembly of samples consisted of pouring beads into 3-inch diameter cylinders with the inner edges coated in clay to reduce edge-affects from increased gas flow between the cylinder side and bead edges (Adolph and Albert 2013). The cylinders had a packing factor for a randomly packed specimen between 0.35 and 0.40 total porosity.2 9   
Permeability of randomly packed spherical particles can be determined theoretically through the Carmen-Kozeny relationships based on total porosity and particle size. The Carmen-Kozeny relationship is as follows:k=ε3*d2/(180*(1-ε)2) (7) Where k is the permeability constant, d is the diameter of the spherical particle and ε isthe porosity of the specimen (Garboczi, 1990).Permeability of each glass bead sample was taken ten times on each permeameterfor the 0.1” and 0.5” pressure transducers. An exception was made for the 0.75mm and 1mm glass beads, these were measured only with the 0.5” pressure transducer because the pressure differential across the bead sample was beyond the 0.1” pressure transducer’s range. Inclusion of both pressure transducers was done to assess the limits of their range for accurate permeability measurement. The results of the tests are displayed in Table 2. Along with permeability measurements on the glass bead samples, approximations of permeability for spherical beads using the Carman-Kozeny relationship are also displayed.Table 2. Calibration results for permeameter models 2010 and 700 using packed glass beads.For all sized glass beads and appropriate pressure transducers, the measured values fell within the literature values for packed glass beads with porosity between 0.35 and 0.40. As bead size and permeability decreased the measured values were in the central range of literature values. Note that the 0.5” pressure transducer was appropriate for the 1mm and￼￼￼￼￼dbead (mm)￼￼￼kmeas2010 model (.1”/.5” Pxducer)￼kmeas700 model (.1”/.5” Pxducer)￼￼￼￼￼kPred Carman-Kozeny(.35-.40 porosity)￼￼￼￼￼3￼￼￼54.75/51.88￼52.88/49.75￼￼￼￼￼50.74-88.89￼￼￼￼￼1￼￼￼---/6.54￼---/7.11￼￼￼￼￼5.64-9.88￼￼￼￼￼0.75￼￼￼￼￼￼---/4.62￼￼￼---/4.70￼￼￼￼￼￼3.17-5.56￼￼￼3 0   
0.75mm glass beads while the 0.1” pressure transducer was appropriate for the 3mm glass beads. While all three sizes of glass beads have similar porosities, the size and tortuosity of the pores play an important role in permeability magnitude.3.3.3 Wedged Membrane Testing for Megadunes PermeabilityThe permeameter holder developed by Rick and Albert (2004) uses a cylindrical firn sample. The firn core taken at the Megadunes site had a segment removed for oxygen isotope analysis and a new, wedged holder was developed for permeability measurements. The following diagram shows the top down view of the new holder and the Megadunes firn core dimensions as well.Figure 11. Diagram of wedged holder and Megadunes firn core including inner base cylinder position.The base that supports the firn specimen has two concentric cylinders in which only the inner flow, and inner pressure differential of the sample is measured to avoid edge effects between the membrane and the sample. While a portion of the outer cylinder was not￼3 1   
covered by Megadunes firn samples, the entire surface area of the inner cylinder was covered ensuring flow and pressure differential measurements were entirely within the firn sample. Tests were done on three firn samples that were initially cylindrical and then cut to the shape of the Megadunes firn core to test the reliability of the wedged holder. Permeability measurements were done twice for each firn sample under both conditions; whole and cut. The results of these measurements are displayed in Table 3 and show changes in permeability between cut and uncut samples below error estimates of a single whole sample of 5-10%.Table 3. Permeability results from testing the wedged membrane holder.3.4 Micro Computed Tomography3.4.1 Micro Computed Tomography Acquisition and SettingsFirn microstructure properties were obtained using x-ray micro computed tomography (microCT). A Skyscan 1172 model microCT was used in a cold room. Scans were run at 40kV with a 250μA current intensity. For each scan, a rotation step of 0.7° was used with the specimen completing 180° rotation. 275 shadow images were obtained and reconstructed using Skyscan’s NRecon software for two dimensional slice reconstruction. The resolution of the images obtained is 14.8μm in which each voxel obtained represents a three dimensional cube with 14.8μm side length. Firn samples were cut to 10mm width x 10mm width x 15mm height from the center of the 5cm-10cm samples used in density and permeability measurements.

Some of these facilities have stations dedicated to microtomography that are available to ovuotxsiedlesgoerne8rmalmusxers8.mItmshxou1ld0mbemnoitnedsitzhea.t in order to realize most of the advantages of synchrotron X-ray sources, imaging is typically limited to relatively small specimens, typically 5–10 mm.The spatial resolution of conventional CT systems is typically limited by the geometry of the X-ray beam along with the characteristics of the detector. As illustrated in Fig. 3,￼Fig. 1 – Schematic illustration of X-ray CT acquisition and reconstruction processes. A series of X-ray projection images is acquired and mathematically reconstructed to produce a 3D map of X-ray absorption in the volume. The 3D map is typicallyFigure 12. Schematic of the x-ray CT process from x-ray source to 3D representationpresented as a series of 2D slice images.(Landis and Keane, 2010).Tracking the CT process from start to finish, figure 12; an x-ray source produces x-rays for a given set-up which pass through the sample to the detector which relays the information in the form of projected images for each step in rotation to a computer program that reconstructs these images into two-dimensional slices piled together into a three-dimensional representation of the sample object (Landis and Keane, 2010).Beam hardening and ring artifacts during acquisition can limit the resolution and accuracy of quantitative analysis of x-ray computed tomography. Beam hardening is the result of lower energy x-rays attenuating more than higher energy x-rays as they pass through the sample. The increase in attenuation of these lower energy x-rays causes the center of the sample to appear dark while the edges appear significantly brighter (Ketcham and Carlson, 2001). The gradation in grey scale from the center of the image3 3   
to the edge can cause issues with phase identification. To reduce acquisition defects, beam hardening was set to 40% for all samples and ring artifact reduction was done manually for each sample within the NRecon reconstruction software.Reconstruction of images applies tomographic reconstruction mathematics, a principle based on solving a series of equations obtained for a given intensity at a specific position in the sample object (Landis and Keane, 2010). Each rotational angle of the CT scanner produces a projection of the object unique to that angle. Combining each projection and solving the series of equations, enables the intensity to be found at each position. These intensities are given grey scale values for each voxel and are used to produce the two-dimensional slices. Because these intensities are related to the attenuation coefficient of the material, distinguishing between phases of differing attenuation coefficients (densities) becomes a matter of thresholding. For thresholding 256 grey levels were used and a thresholding value of 89 was set between the air and the ice phase.Figure 13. Image of grey level thresholding and binarized firn 2d firn slice.The large difference in linear attenuation coefficients (x-ray absorption) between ice and air enables a simple thresholding limit to be used to binarize the images. To reduce noise￼3 4   
and minimize falsely counting incorrectly binarized voxels as pores or small ice clusters, all white specs less than 25 voxels surrounded by black voxels were removed and vice versa. Image analysis on both the ice phase and pore phase was done to obtain the microstructure properties of both the ice structure and pore structure of the firn sample.3.4.2 Microstructural PropertiesThe microstructural properties, derived using Skyscan’s CTan software, include total porosity, open porosity, closed porosity, structural model index, surface to volume ratio, and anisotropy. Microstructural properties were obtained on both the ice and pore phases. The total porosity of the sample is determined by counting the total number of voxels present for the ice phase and dividing that by the total number of voxels within the region of interest. Open porosity is defined as any pore that intersects with the edge of the region of interest at least once. From the total and open porosity values, the closed porosity of a sample can quickly be determined through subtraction. To account for closed pores that were cut during sample preparation, pore size distribution was determined for all of the samples where the majority of closed pores had volumes of 1mm3 or less. Through individual object analysis all pores with a center within 0.62mm (the radius of a 1mm3 spherical pore) of the edge of the region of interest were considered closed. Open porosity and closed porosity were then adjusted accordingly for each sample. Corrections to closed porosity were small, Figure 14.3 5   
￼Figure 14. Closed porosity correction of all samplesThe structure model index, (SMI), gives an estimation for the type of shape present in the analyzed phase. SMI values of 0, 3 and 4 correspond to an ideal plate, cylinder, and sphere respectively. Calculation of SMI follows that developed by Hildebrand et al. (1997) in which one voxel thickness is added to the surface of the phase analyzed. SMI is then calculated as follows:SMI=6*(S’*V)/S2 (8) Where S’ is the artificially increased surface area, S is the original surface area, and V isthe initial volume of the analyzed phase. For convex shapes, SMI is positive while concave structures have negative SMI values. The surface to volume ratio, (S/V), gives the ratio of the analyzed phase surface area to the volume of the phase in three dimensions. It gives estimation of how tortuous an object is where a low S/V indicates3 6   
less complexity in shape than a high S/V (Morphometric parameters measured by SkyscanTM CT- analyser software, Bruker-MicroCT CT-Analyser, http://www.skyscan.be).Anisotropy is a measure of alignment or three-dimensional symmetry within theregion of interest. The value of anisotropy is determined using the mean intercept length;the length of a line traveling through an object divided by the number of times the linecrosses the phase being analyzed. The higher the mean intercept length the more theobject is aligned in a single direction indicating a high degree of anisotropy.￼Skyscan N.V., Aartselaar, BelgiumVector 2￼￼￼￼￼Figure 3.

A firn size of 8mm x 8mm x8mm has been determined to be sufficient in other studies (Coleou and others, 2001; Kaempfer and Schneebeli, 2007, Freitag et al., 2004, Courville et al., 2010).

Microstructure parameters of 5 firn samples scanned twice on the microCT.While the relative difference in total porosity, open porosity, closed porosity, surface to volume ratio, and anisotropy are generally below 15%, structure model index3 8   
shows higher variability. SMI is very dependent upon where the region of interest is placed and the number of pores that are dissected by it because it is a measure of pore convexity or concavity. The sample from WAIS Divide has the highest porosity and also the largest difference in structure model index. As SMI is an indicator of pore shape and is not used quantitatively for any other reason, these discrepancies are ignored. Differences and trends with both depth and between cores, in total porosity, open porosity, closed porosity and surface to volume ratio, are greater than 15% and are thus considered significant. Due to time constraints and error less than 15% in quantitative parameters, from the above 4 samples, the majority of samples were scanned once. Error bars are not included on microstructure parameters but are assumed to be less than 15% and likely within the natural variability of polar firn in a single horizontal layer. Error in an individual sample was been found to be ≤10% for permeability measurements, and thus error over all measurements is of approximately the same magnitude.3 9   
4 Results4.1 StratigraphyFirn is a layered, porous media and thus noting the stratigraphy profile of a given firn column is important for understanding how microstructure relates to bulk properties.￼Figure 16. Image of WAIS Divide firn at a depth of 40.6m.Centimeter scale layering can be seen in the WAIS Divide firn core at all depths. Figure 16, firn from 40.6m depth at WAIS Divide has alternating layers of fine grained and coarse grained firn as well as a wind crust in the center of the image.4 0   
￼Figure 17. Image of Megadunes firn at a depth of 41.2m.Figure 17 shows the abrupt switch from a past accumulation site to a past hiatus site at 41.2m depth for the Megadunes firn core. The past accumulation site consists of fine grained firn while the past hiatus site is made of coarse grained firn. Note the lack of layering in the sample other than the one transition. Megadunes firn has large coarse grains while WAIS Divide has finer smaller grains at equivalent depths (Figures 16 and 17). Another distinction between the Megadunes and WAIS Divide is the scale over which layering exists. At Megadunes, large sections of core, up to several meters long will be either predominately coarse grained or predominately fine grained. On the other hand, the firn at WAIS Divide has quick alternations, on the centimeter scale, between coarse grained layers and fine grained layers.4.2 DensityA common practice in firn studies is measuring the density profile of the firn column. Density cross-overs within polar firn have been observed at multiple sites4 1   
including in Northern Greenland, Dome Fuji and Berkner Island in Antarctica, as well as many more (Freitag et al., 2004, Hori et al., 1999, Gerland et al.,1999, Horhold et al., 2011).￼Figure 18. Density profiles of Megadunes (red diamonds) and WAIS Divide (black stars) from the surface to 80m.Figure 18 shows the density profiles for both WAIS Divide and Megadunes. While Megadunes firn is initially less dense than the firn at WAIS Divide, it is more dense at the lock-in depth and pore close-off. Worth noting is that Megadunes firn consists of much coarser grains at depth than WAIS Divide firn and that Megadunes firn is more dense than WAIS Divide firn at depth.4 2   
￼Figure 19. Density cross-over at WAIS Divide from the surface to 80m where fine grain (green diamonds), coarse grain (black stars), and all other samples (red circles).Throughout the firn column, fine grained and coarse grained layers are determined visually based on their relative grain size to other firn layers in the surrounding one meter of firn. Plotted in figure 19 is the evolution of fine grained and coarse grained firn layers with depth at WAIS Divide. At WAIS Divide, initially dense layers correspond to fine grained firn at the surface, where as at the bottom of the firn column, dense layers correspond to coarse grained firn. The exact location of the cross- over is difficult to pinpoint in figure 19. Higher resolution density measurements on the WDC06A core show the minima in density variability occurs around 30m at WAIS Divide (Kreutz et al., 2011).4 3

(a Courville, PhD Thesis)￼￼￼Table 5. Accumulation/hiatus transitions and corresponding density measurements above (fine grain) and below (coarse grain) the transition depth.Megadunes firn exhibits no density cross-over between fine grained and coarse grained layers; the coarsest grain firn remains less dense than the finest grained firn from the surface through the LIZ. Firn with grains between the coarsest and finest layers at Megadunes have some density variability but not as extreme as the direct switch from the fine grains to the coarse grains. Table 5 summarizes dune transition locations where firn layers dramatically switch from dense fine grained layers to less dense coarse grain layers over several millimeters.4.3 PermeabilityWhile density gives the amount of mass present, permeability gives an approximation of the open pore space of a given porous media. Permeability measurements were done from approximately ten meters (53m at Megadunes and 55m at WAIS Divide) above the LID determined by firn air studies (Severinghaus et al., 2010, Battle et al., 2011).4 4   
￼Figure 20. Permeability profile of deep firn at WAIS DivideFirn air measurements give a lock-in depth at WAIS Divide between 66-68m (Battle et al., 2011). The lock-in depth determined through permeability measurements on individual firn samples for WAIS Divide is 63.85m, indicative of the depth at which several consecutive samples are impermeable. The first impermeable sample occurs a few meters above the LID at 58.47m. This depth is not considered the LID due to the three dimensionality of polar firn where one impermeable layer from a firn core may not be horizontally significant in nature.4 5   
￼Figure 21. Permeability profile of deep firn at MegadunesFirn air measurements produce a lock-in depth at 64.8m at Megadunes (Severinghaus et al, 2010). Permeability measurements of Megadunes firn indicate the LID at 64.37m almost perfectly aligned with the LID from firn air measurements. The first measured impermeable layers is found at 58.28m for Megadunes. As was previously mentioned for the permeability profile of WAIS Divide, a single impermeable layer is not considered horizontally significant in nature and thus not considered the LID.4 6   
￼Figure 22. Permeability and density profiles below 53m through pore close-off for Megadunes (red diamonds) and WAIS Divide (black stars).The permeability profiles of both Megadunes and WAIS Divide seen in figure 22, and plotted individually in figures 20 and 21, are of the same magnitude from 55m to the LID or start of the lock-in zone. Interestingly, the density profiles from the same depth interval show Megadunes firn to be consistently denser than WAIS Divide firn. The permeabilities within the lock-in zone at Megadunes have more scatter than the permeabilities of WAIS Divide within the lock-in zone. The lock-in zone at Megadunes is also shorter than the lock-in zone at WAIS Divide that extends to almost 75m. The similarities in permeability but differences in densities between both sites suggest the pore structure of the firn plays has an impact on gas transport properties within polar firn.4.4 Microstructure4 7   
4.4.1 Visual 3D ReconstructionsMicrostructure imaging helps to understand the reasons for different density and permeability profiles at Megadunes and WAIS Divide. Figures 23 and 24 display three- dimensional reconstructions obtained using microcomputed tomography. The width and thickness of the reconstructed firn cubes is 8mm while the height is 10mm.Figure 23.

WAIS Divide 3D pore space reconstruction where white is the pore phase.Visually Megadunes firn (Figure 23) has larger but less total pore space at an equivalent depth than WAIS Divide (Figure 24). The pore structure at WAIS Divide also looks more complex and divided. For both sites, total pore space decreases and the occurrence of bubbles increases with depth.4.4.2 Microstructural ParametersMicrostructure analysis enables quantification and validation of differences in visual observations seen between the two sites. Microstructural parameters analyzed on the pore phase include structure model index (SMI), surface to volume ration (S/V), and anisotropy.4 9   
￼Figure 25. Structure model index for WAIS Divide (black stars) and Megadunes (red diamonds) in deep firn.The SMI profile, an indicator of pore shape, is the same for Megadunes and WAIS Divide with depth. The pore structure at Megadunes and WAIS Divide (Figure 4) is primarily cylindrical at 55m with increasing SMI, evolving to spheres towards the firn- ice transition. A linear fit to the data shows a slightly steeper slope in SMI for Megadunes a sign that the pore structure at Megadunes may become spherical bubbles at a shallower depth than the pore structure at WAIS Divide.5 0   
￼Figure 26. Surface to volume ratio for WAIS Divide (black stars) and Megadunes (red diamonds) in deep firn.5 1   
￼Figure 27. Surface to volume ratio for WAIS Divide (black stars) and Megadunes (red diamonds) plotted against density in deep firn.Surface to volume ratio (S/V) characterizes the complexity of a structure and can serve as a proxy for tortuosity (Spaulding et al., 2011). Megadunes firn has consistently lower values of S/V than WAIS Divide indicating a less tortuous pore structure at a given depth (Figure 26). S/V at Megadunes is lower than at WAIS Divide at equivalent densities as well (Figure 27). Comparing S/V between the two sites, finding Megadunes firn to be less complex than WAIS Divide firn, confirms visual observations made on the 3D firn cube reconstructions.5 2   
￼Figure 28. Anisotropy for WAIS Divide (black stars) and Megadunes (red diamonds)Anisotropy profiles of both sites overlap and are almost completely isotropic. Using these microstructure parameters to describe pore structure, Megadunes and WAIS Divide pores are isotropic and evolving from cylindrical type shapes to spheres in deep firn. The difference occurs in tortuosity of the pore matrix, indicated by S/V, where WAIS Divide is more tortuous than Megadunes at a given depth and at a given density.4.4.3 PorosityPorosity of polar firn decreases with depth as firn densifies and serves as an indicator for the magnitude and type of gas transport present in the firn column. Total porosity of polar firn is the ratio of the air space to the ice matrix within a given volume. Total5 3   
porosity is a direct reflection of density in porous media, and is generally calculated directly from the measured density of bulk samples as:P=(1-ρ/ρice) (4) Where P is the porosity of the sample, ρ is the density of the sample, and ρice is thedensity of pure ice (0.917 g⋅cm-3). While total porosity reflects the density of a sample, open porosity gives the amount of interstitial air space available for gas transport. All pores categorized as open are assumed to connect via the complex pore network to the atmosphere. In contrast, closed porosity, gives the amount of air volume completely surrounded by ice where gas transport cannot occur. All porosity measurements in this study were derived from microcomputed tomography analysis on individual firn cubes.￼5 4   
Figure 29. Total Porosity (% of sample) for Megadunes (red diamonds) and WAIS Divide (black stars)￼Figure 30. Open Porosity (% of sample) for Megadunes (red diamonds) and WAIS Divide (black stars)Figures 29 and 30 show both total porosity and open porosity of Megadunes firn is consistently lower than in WAIS Divide firn at a given depth. Both total and open porosity are decreasing with depth due to the densification of firn as the pore structure becomes more segregated. Despite having lower open porosity, it is visually evident that a lower tortuosity of the pore matrix causes Megadunes firn to be more permeable than firn at WAIS Divide at a given density. A less tortuous pore structure allows for greater air flow than if the pore structure has many twists and turns.5 5   
￼Figure 31. Closed Porosity (% of Total Porosity) for Megadunes (red diamonds) and WAIS Divide (black stars)While total and open porosity gradually decrease with depth, closed porosity dramatically increases below the LID. Closed porosity at Megadunes and WAIS Divide is less than 8% above the LID (Figure 31). Below the LID, closed porosity increases and has greater variability. To understand the increase in closed porosity with no change seen in total porosity, the number and size of pores were examined.5 6   
￼Figure 32. Profiles of log pore size (top), pore size (middle) and number of pores (bottom) of pores greater than 0.001mm3 in deep firn, 55m to 80m, for Megadunes (red) and WAIS Divide (black).Figure 32 shows a decrease in pore size below the LID with a large increase in the total number of pores below the LID. As pore close-off progresses, WAIS Divide has more variability in the total number of pores than Megadunes within the LIZ. This is likely due to the small scale layering of firn at high accumulation sites in comparison to firn at low accumulation sites (Landais et al., 2006, Mitchell et al., 2013, in progress). For pores less than 10 mm3, the pores at WAIS Divide tend to be smaller than those at Megadunes. For both sites, the abrupt increase in closed porosity at the LID corresponds with dissection of larger open pores in multiple locations to form many smaller closed or5 7   
almost closed pores. The dissection of large open pores begins at an open porosity of ~8% at Megadunes and ~11% at WAIS Divide.Figure 33. CPF for Megadunes (red) and WAIS Divide (black from 56-76m).Another method used by Lomonaco et al. (2011) to observe the pore close-off process is the closed pore fraction (CPF) defined as the number of pores divided by the total pore volume of a given sample. Plotting CPF with depth for Megadunes and WAIS Divide, Figure 7, shows a steady CPF of ~1, slightly lower for WAIS Divide, until a depth of 63m. Below 63m, the CPF increases with depth at a constant slope through the LIZ. While the magnitude of CPF is slightly lower in the present study, the same trend in the rate of CPF increase, was observed through the LIZ at Summit by Lomonaco et al. (2011). The increase in CPF in the LIZ of polar firn is the result of large open pores that are abruptly dissected by the ice matrix initiating the LIZ. As firn is a layered material,￼5 8   
variability in CPF is due to microstructural differences between fine grained and coarse grained firn.5 9   
5 Discussion5.1 Impact of Megadunes on Δage5.1.1 Shallow LID due to Antidunes PresenceThe lock-in depth of present day firn columns can be determined in-situ through firn air measurements or after the core has been drilled, in the laboratory through permeability measurements. Due to the three dimensional nature of the firn the lock-in depth is defined as the depth at which multiple sequential samples are impermeable assuming horizontal homogeneity at depth in the firn column.￼Figure 34. Permeability profile of Megadunes from 53m to 75m. The LID is at 64.4m.Figure 34 shows the permeability profile surrounding the lock-in depth at Megadunes. The firn has permeabilities ranging from 0.3x10-10m2 to 1.0 x10-10m2 at 55m6 0   
depth. A lone impermeable sample occurs at a depth of 58.3m and is not considered the LID due to the 3D nature of polar firn. The LID occurs at 64.4m where multiple sequential samples are impermeable. Below the LID, also known as the lock-in zone, alternating permeable and impermeable samples continue until all samples have zero permeability signifying total pore close-off or the close-off depth. Within the lock-in zone no permeability is greater than 0.2 x10-10m2. In agreement with permeability measurements, firn air measurements done by Severinghaus et al. (2010) determine the LID to be 64.5m based on sharp inflection points in the CO2 and CH4 data and a deviation in the slope of δ15N concentrations with depth signaling the end of the diffusive zone.The LID of sites with similar climate conditions to Megadunes (-49°C, &lt;4cm weq yr-1) such as Vostok and Dome C are much deeper. Table 6 shows the accumulation rate, average surface temperature, measured LID (LID) and modeled close-off depth (CODmodel) (Landais et al., 2006) after models of Arnaud et al., (2000) and Barnola et al., (1991).Table 6. Pore close-off modeled results for Vostok, Antarctica and Dome C.Comparison with sites of similar climatic conditions shows that the LID observed through firn air measurements and permeability measurements at Megadunes is significantly shallower (64.4m) than the measured LID at both Vostok and Dome C (100m and 98m respectively). The firn densification models also predict a deeper LID of 100m for both sites (Landais et al., 2006).￼￼￼￼Site￼￼Accumulation Rate(ice eq yr-1)￼Average Surface Temperature (°C)￼￼￼￼￼LID(m)￼￼￼CODmodel(Arnaud et al., 2000) (m)￼￼￼CODmodel(Barnola et al., 1991) (m)￼￼￼￼V ostok￼￼￼￼2.4￼￼-55.5￼￼￼￼￼￼100￼￼￼￼￼￼100￼￼￼￼￼100￼￼￼￼Dome C￼2.7-54.5￼￼￼98￼￼100￼￼100￼6 1   
To understand the 35m discrepancy between the expected LID at a site like Megadunes and the observed LID at Megadunes the physical properties of the firn are examined. Surface observations made at antidune locations (Frezzotti et al., 2002 and Courville et al., 2007) show accumulation sites, with 3-4cm weq yr-1, on the windward side of the dune have a microstructure consisting of small closely packed fine grains. In contrast, the hiatus or ablation sites, with 0cm weq yr-1, on the leeward faces and troughs, have a microstructure consisting of large faceted grains (Courville et al., 2007). Ground penetrating radar, figure 35, taken of the site by Ted Scambos shows alternating diagonal light and dark bands where past dune faces have been buried as the antidunes migrate upwind. The radar line was taken 300m off-profile of the borehole giving approximate dune face locations.Figure 35.

The large number of wind crusts present at only the accumulation site allows us to use wind crusts as a proxy down through the firn column for when past accumulation sites dissect the borehole in conjunction with visual stratigraphy. As the dunes are buried and compressed their frequency with depth increases. The rate at which6 3   
the dunes migrated upwind and their spatial variability in the past could also affect their frequency in the column. Combining the radar image, wind crust frequency, and visual stratigraphy, past accumulation sites pass through the firn column at the drill location at 20m, 35m, 40m, 47m, 53m, 58m, and 64m. Below 64m, the distinction between dunes becomes harder to observe due to an increase in frequency.Permeability gives an indication of pore structure and responds to the enduring signature of past hiatus and accumulation sites.￼Figure 37. Top 30m of Megadunes log of permeability profile with depth (Courville, PhD Thesis).In figure 37, in the top 30m of the firn column, permeability measurements increase due to coarse grains (past hiatus site) around 15m and 24m while decreasing due to fine grains (accumulation site) around 20m and again near 30m as the accumulation site at6 4   
35m is approached. At depth, decreases in permeability occur at depths coincident with past accumulation sites. Looking back at figure 34, the locally impermeable sample at 58.3m occurs in the middle of an accumulation site characterized by small grains and lower overall porosity. Multiple impermeable samples starting at 64.4m indicating the LID also occur in a past accumulation site. Below the LID the increased frequency of the dunes causes the variability in permeability until total pore close-off.Without the presence of the antidunes at Megadunes, and the subsequent propagation of distinct accumulation sites (fine grained) down through the firn column, the LID would not have occurred at 64.4m. The LID would have likely been much deeper, approximately 100m on par with the LID observed and modeled for Vostok and Dome C (Landais et al., 2006). The alternate locations of accumulation and ablation at the surface of Megadunes creates meter scale layering of the firn column much different than the firn found at any other present day site and it is therefor unsurprising that using the average accumulation rate and temperature at Megadunes to model firn densification would not capture the correct behavior of the firn and would overestimate the LID.5.1.2 Antidunes and the data-model mismatchA shallow LID and the propensity for deep convection due to antidunes decreases the length of the diffusive column causing lower concentrations of δ15N to become trapped into bubbles. δ15N concentrations at the LID of Megadunes relates to a diffusive column height of 41m (Severinghaus et al., 2010) yet the modeled LID of 100m, of sites similar to Megadunes, would add an additional 35m to the diffusive column height and an increase in gravitational fractionation would be expected. Knowing that antidunes alter the LID and subsequently lowers δ15N concentrations points to flaws in the firn6 5   
densification models for the large data-model mismatch. Recently Parrenin et al. (2013) used tie points between Dome C and Dronning Maud Land over the last glacial transition to determine a Δage that showed good agreement with those estimated from δ15N measurements at Dome C.We postulate that the overestimation of LID from firn densification models during glacial-interglacial transitions and glacial periods at very low accumulation sites could be due to a shallow LID the direct result of inhomogeneous accumulation and antidunes. Antidunes decrease the amount of δ15N gravitational fractionation from two mechanisms, deep convection; due to high surface permeability and macro cracks at ablation sites, and a shallow LID; due to premature pore close-off of firn originating as a past accumulation site. Firn densification models have no way to capture the unsteady-state behavior of an antidunes site, specifically the pronounced differences between zero accumulation or ablation and 2cm weq yr-1, a fingerprint of antidunes. Courville et al. (2007) gave three main indications that may be present in deep ice cores to identify an antidunes presence at the site: 1) A hiatus band will show up as a thick, uniform layer without any annual cycles present, 2) the ice will show more evidence of post depositional processing, and 3) there would likely be altered isotopic and chemical species concentrations.An overestimation in LID at a low accumulation site leads to a large overestimate in Δage. An overestimation of 35m in LID at an accumulation rate of 2cm weq yr-1 accounts for up to 2,000 years in the age of the ice. If antidunes were present during glacial periods, for sites such as Vostok, Dome Fuji, and Dome C, the overestimation of LID seen in firn densification models would be expected because the steady-state assumption and calibration properties do not apply under antidunes conditions. A6 6   
shallow LID and the propensity for deep convection due to antidunes decreases the length of the diffusive column leading to low values of δ15N trapped within the core which is typical of glacial time periods. The shallow LID reduces the necessity for excessively deep convective zones of up to 40m to resolve the data-model mismatch during glacial and transition periods. Relying on firn densification models for past LID at very low accumulation sites outside of present day climate conditions creates a Δage too large, during climatic conditions typical of antidunes formation. A decrease in Δage due to the presence of antidunes could decrease much of the discrepancy and controversy that currently exists in the synchronicity of atmospheric CO2 and temperature seen during glacial-interglacial transitions.5.2 Layering in Polar FirnLayering at WAIS Divide occurs much differently than at Megadunes due to a significantly higher accumulation rate of 22 cm yr-1 ice equivalent and an absence of antidunes. At WAIS Divide distinct summer and winter layers are formed within which individual storm events can be distinguished. Annual layers at the depth of the lock-in zone are approximately 0.25m thick (Mitchell et al., 2013) which one would expect to lead to high permeability variability on the half meter scale due to multiple seasons present and their variability in density and pore structure. The relative difference in permeability is defined as:Δkrel=[(kmax-kmin)/kavg]*100 (10) Where kmax and kmin are the maximum and minimum permeabilities present in a half-meter range and kavg is the average permeability of all samples within half a meter. The relative difference rather than the absolute difference is used in order to compare between6 7   
various depths at a single site and between two sites. This calculation was done on both Megadunes and WAIS Divide firn from 55m through the lock-in zone to pore close-off.Figure 38. Relative Difference in Permeability on a half-meter scale from 55m through pore close-off. Megadunes (red) and WAIS Divide (black).Figure 38 shows WAIS Divide as having consistently higher permeability variability until the start of the lock-in zone agreeing with the hypothesis that inter-annual variations due to initial surface deposition influences the gas transport in deep firn. Once the lock-in zone is reached with many samples having zero permeability, the relative difference in permeability sky-rockets due impermeable firn layers and no longer serves as an indicator of inter-annual microstructural firn properties. The centimeter scale￼6 8   
microstructure layering causes a large depth and density range of impermeable samples creating a larger lock-in zone at WAIS Divide than at Megadunes.Looking at permeability variability as an indication of layering between Megadunes and WAIS Divide indicates that high accumulation sites retain more centimeter scale layering. This small scale layering is the result of surface deposition and short residency time on the surface of the ice sheet in comparison to low accumulation sites, where snow crystals sit on the surface for much longer causing the firn to coarsen and homogenize on the centimeter scale (Albert et al, 2004, Rick and Albert, 2004). The presence of antidunes at the Megadunes location is unique for a low accumulation site, and leads to meter scale layering affects within the firn column as the antidunes migrate upwind and are subsequently buried. As the dunes are buried and compressed the affects of their layering happen over smaller and smaller depth ranges. If dunes are not present at low accumulation sites, the time a portion of firn sits at the surface and within the firn column, up to ten times the amount of time of a high accumulation site, results in a more microstructurally homogenous firn column showing little to no lock-in zone, a feature noted by Landais et al. (2006). In contrast, high accumulation rates, such as that seen at WAIS Divide, increase microstructural variability on the centimeter scale causing high and low permeability layers to exist within close proximity to each other. Often these layers correspond to winter and summer layers but can be the result of individual storm events as well. In conjunction with the lock-in zone lengths observed in this study, measurements of lock-in zone length during firn air campaigns across Antarctica and Greenland show longer lock-in zones at high accumulation sites and shorter to no lock-in6 9   
zone at low accumulation sites (Landais et al, 2006, Battle et al, 1996, Etheridge et al, 1996, Schwander et al 1993, Battle et al, 2011, Severinghaus et al, 2010).5.3 Impact of physical properties on pore close-off5.3.1 Macroscopic Properties: Density and PermeabilityDensity and permeability measurements made between 30-36 m and 55-80 m at Megadunes and WAIS Divide are displayed in Figure 39. For both sites, the 30-36 m depths are many meters above the lock-in zone, and the lock-in zone falls within the 55- 80 m depths. It can be seen from the overall profiles that in the 30-36 m depths above the lock-in zone, the Megadunes site is much more permeable than the WAIS Divide site. Their density profiles at this depth range are similar. In addition, it is evident that even for a given density in the 30-36 m depth range, Megadunes firn is more permeable than WAIS Divide firn, above the lock-in zone.￼Figure 39. Density 30m-36m (top right), permeability 30m-36m (top middle), density/permeability relationship 30m-36m (top left), density 55m-80m (bottom right),7 0   
permeability 55m-80m (bottom middle), density/permeability relationship 55m-80m (bottom left) for WAIS Divide (black) and Megadunes (red).The relationships are different within the lock-in zone. For depths between 55-80 m just above and within the lock in zone, it can be seen from figure 39 that Megadunes firn is more dense than WAIS Divide but the permeability profiles are similar. Very near and within the lock-in zone, the relationship existing between density and permeability shows that Megadunes firn is more permeable for any given density than is the WAIS Divide firn. The LID, defined as the depth where multiple sequential samples are impermeable, is at 64.4 m at Megadunes and 63.8 m at WAIS Divide indicated by a red and black line respectively.5.3.2 Application to densification models and LIZ characteristicsPore close-off is traditionally defined in layered firn as the process in which individual layers of firn become impermeable and proceeds until all layers are impermeable or closed-off. In the current literature on pore close-off, density controls the depth at which pore close-off occurs in an individual layer and dense layers are thought to close off shallower than low density layers (Martinerie et al., 1992). Combining density driven pore close-off and noting the density cross-over observed in polar firn (Horhold et al., 2011), the first firn layers in deep firn to reach pore close-off should be the high density, coarse grained layers. Our observations of close-off including microstructure and density between Megadunes and WAIS Divide suggest that microstructure, rather than density, is the main driving force for pore close-off. At depth, Megadunes firn is consistently more dense than WAIS Divide firn yet the permeability profiles above the LID and the LID for both sites are almost identical, 64.4 m and 63.8 m7 1   
respectively. To explain the lack of a direct relationship between density and permeability between Megadunes and WAIS Divide the tortuosity of the pore structure must be taken into account. Megadunes, has larger grains than WAIS Divide at a given density leading to a less tortuous pore structure causing higher permeabilities at a given density in Megadunes firn than those observed at WAIS Divide.It should be noted that previous estimates, such as those developed by Martinerie et al. (1992) of mean pore close-off density are almost directly at the peak of a Gaussian type density distribution for all impermeable layers within the lock-in zone at each site, figure 40. Megadunes, a cold site with an average temperature of -49°C, has a predicted mean pore close-off density of 0.830 g⋅cm-3 higher than 0.821 g⋅cm-3 at WAIS Divide, a warmer site with an average temperature of -31°C . The density range of the distribution and length of the LIZ, are dependent upon the microstructure variability between firn layers and agree with Landais et al. (2006) who postulated that low accumulation sites will have smaller lock-in zones from an homogenous firn column and lack of annual layering.7 2   
￼Figure 40. Density distribution of impermeable firn samples from the LID to the end of the LIZ where all samples are impermeable at Megadunes (top) and WAIS Divide (bottom). Martinerie predictions of pore close-off density are shown as vertical lines.While comparison between two sites of significantly different local climates reveals that microstructure plays a significant role in dictating permeability and pore close-off, identifying the same trend at an individual site would further strengthen our hypothesis and constrain the impact of temperature verse accumulation rate on the process. Both Megadunes and WAIS Divide were individually analyzed by identifying fine grained and coarse grained layers within the firn column and observing their relationship with both density and permeability.As commonly seen in polar sites, WAIS Divide firn exhibits a density cross-over in which initially high density layers consisting of fine grained firn are less dense than7 3   
corresponding initially low density layers consisting of coarse grained firn.Figure 41. Density cross-over of fine and coarse gain firn at WAIS Divide (left) and deep firn permeability profile at WAIS Divide (right) both show fine firn (green), coarse firn (red), and intermediate firn (black).The density cross-over in figure 41 has been noted at WAIS Divide in high resolution density measurements on firn core WDC06A done by Kreutz et al. (2011) with a minima in density variability occurring around 30 m. In the right plot of figure 9, fine grained layers become impermeable shallower than coarse grained layers and a coarse grained layer is the last permeable layer of the LIZ. Therefore, despite having a lower density at depth, fine grained firn reaches pore close-off first at WAIS Divide. This implies that accumulation and near surface metamorphism resulting in either fine grained or coarse grained layers, independent of temperature, remain as identifiable features of￼7 4   
the layers as they propagate down the column, leading to shallower pore close-off in fine grain layers at WAIS Divide.In contrast, Megadunes does not exhibit a density cross-over and initially dense fine grained firn at surface accumulation sites on the upwind dune face remains more dense than coarse grained firn from surface hiatus sites on the leeward dune face through pore close-off. The fine grained, dense firn originating from a past accumulation site at Megadunes becomes the first impermeable layers initiating the start of the LIZ. The ability of fine grained firn to become impermeable before coarse grained firn in this study at both WAIS Divide and Megadunes, as well as in previous studies (Freitag et al., 2004) regardless of whether or not it was the predominately dense layer at depth emphasizes the importance of grain size and pore structure when predicting gas transport and pore close- off in polar firn. A recent study by Horhold et al. (2011) correlated an increase in accumulation rate to an increase in density variability in deep firn leading to longer LIZs. While we agree that density variability due to layering does indeed increase for high accumulation sites, the density cross-over seen in most polar firn sites leads to an inverse relationship of density and microstructure in deep firn where fine grained layers are less dense than coarse grained layers. Because they are both based on the layering, microstructure will have high layer-to-layer variability in places where layering also makes the density variable. The microstructure variability between fine grained and coarse grained layers, likely of the same magnitude of the density variability observed by Horhold et al. (2011), controls the length of the LIZ. For polar sites, fine grained layers should reach pore close-off at shallower depths than coarse grained layers. To capture this behavior, firn densification models should include two pore close-off densities, one7 5   
corresponding to the finest grained layers that will predict the LID and one corresponding to the coarsest grained layers that will predict the COD. In this way, the LID, COD, and LIZ length can be accurately estimated based on the accumulation rate of a site and the resulting microstructure variability. While Megadunes is unique due to the presence of buried antidunes, we believe that low accumulation sites should exhibit less microstructure variability in deep firn following trends of density variability developed by Horhold et al. (2011) for low accumulation sites. Separate close-off densities for fine grained and coarse grained firn should be utilized to define the LIZ in firn densification models at both high and low accumulation sites based on our observations of microstructure dependent close-off.For a physical description of why fine grain firn reaches pore close-off first, we hypothesize that the grain size of the ice and neck size of the pore structure in firn leads to a threshold in open porosity corresponding to pore close-off in a single layer of firn. Freitag et al. (2004) found that coarse grained layers densify at a quicker rate than fine grained layers but the pore size of both layers decreased at the same rate. Therefore in conjunction with our findings, whichever layer has smaller pores at the surface (the fine grained layer) should close-off first. Rick and Albert (2004) and Courville et al. (2007) both found that buried layers retain evidence of their character when they were in the near-surface firn. The larger grains at Megadunes and subsequent larger pore necks enables the firn at Megadunes to reach a higher density and lower open porosity of ~8% before the open pore space is quickly dissected into many smaller closed pores. At WAIS Divide, the open porosity threshold occurs higher at ~11% open porosity, due to the smaller ice grains and smaller necks in the pore structure. For a given accumulation7 6   
rate, fine grained firn will have the highest open porosity at pore close-off, coarse grained firn layers will have the lowest open porosity at pore close-off and intermediate grain size layers should have open porosity thresholds for close-off in between the two extremes. Extrapolating this relationship across a variety of accumulation rates, high accumulation rates typically lead to smaller grains and should have high open porosity (&gt;10%), low density at pore close-off while low accumulation sites with larger grains should have low open porosity (&lt;10%), high density at pore close-off.5.3.3 Application to Firn Air ModelsIncreasing the understanding of how microstructure affects diffusivity in deep firn through the LIZ should decrease the necessity for inverse modeling based on present day firn air measurements within firn gas transport models. Initial diffusivity profiles within polar firn are typically modeled off the Schwander et al. (1988) parameterization of firn tortuosity as a function of porosity, despite recognition by Fabre et al. (2000) who found that tortuosity profiles are site to site dependent. A recent attempt to model permeability and diffusivity as a function of open porosity, was done by Freitag et al., (2002) on 3D reconstructed firn cubes. The permeability constant k was fit to open porosity with the following power law:k=10-7.7*n 3.4 (11) opwhere nop is the open porosity of the sample (Freitag et al., 2002). The power law fit allowed for permeable firn below 0.12 open porosity the threshold for permeable firn in previous studies done by Fabre et al. (2000) and Schwander et al. (1988).7 7   
￼Figure 42. Measured and predicted (blue line, Freitag et al., 2002) permeability values (left) and relative error (right) for Megadunes (red) and WAIS Divide (black).Plotting permeability data for Megadunes and WAIS Divide in figure 42 shows high scatter around the power law fit from measured permeability for both sites, though the general curve of the power law can be seen. The power law function fails most at low open porosity values (5-10%) at Megadunes where the firn is 200-700% more permeable than predicted with the power law function. The large error at Megadunes is likely due to the large difference in local climate at Megadunes in comparison to the climate of Greenland where the firn in the Freitag et al. (2002) study originated. The dependence of pore structure, on grain size and accumulation rate, influences gas transport in the diffusive column along with controlling pore close-off. The low accumulation rate, large grain size, and larger less tortuous pore structure at Megadunes enables the firn to be7 8   
much more permeable than predicted by Freitag et al. (2002). As WAIS Divide has a local climate much similar to Greenland, the error between modeled and measured permeability is not as large.In deep firn it has been shown that diffusivity and permeability are linearly related (Adolph et al., 2013) and thus the connection between permeability and grain size/pore structure can be extrapolated to diffusivity. Firn air models that use density profiles derived from firn densification models to determine the open porosity which is then used to calculate the effective diffusivity profile of a specific gas (Buizert et al., 2012) will fall short of capturing the true nature of gas transport in deep firn. A given open porosity at a high accumulation site will lead to lower observed gas diffusivity than the diffusivity observed at a low accumulation site. The microstructure must be accounted for to improve physics based models of diffusivity in polar firn. The dependence of grain size on accumulation rate and near surface residence time observed by Albert et al. (2004), Rick and Albert (2004), Courville et al. (2007), and Fujita et al. (2009) along with an increase in gas transport due to an increase in grain size shown in this study could be used to create site specific effective open porosity profiles. An effective open porosity profile derived from local climate parameters, specifically accumulation rate, which captures gas transport dependence on pore structure, should improve forward firn air modeling. If the physics of forward firn air modeling can be accurately captured through climate parameters it should reduce the need for inverse modeling and enhance the reliability of forward modeling of past firn columns where inverse modeling is not plausible.5.3.4 Summary of local climate impacts on pore close-off and gas transport7 9   
Microstructure is the main driving force for pore close-off in which fine grained firn is seen to reach pore-close off at shallower depths than coarse grained firn regardless of density. These results should be incorporated into firn densification models by the inclusion of two pore close-off densities; one for the finest grained layers which would give the LID and one for coarsest grained layers corresponding to the COD. Because they are both based on the layering, microstructure in highly-layered firn will have high variability in places where layering also makes the density variable. Thus the microstructure will have high variability in the deep firn of high accumulation sites. In relation to pore close-off, a threshold is seen in open porosity, a result of accumulation rate and near surface grain size propagating down the firn column into deep firn. At porosities lower than the threshold (&gt;10% for high accumulation sites and &lt;10% for low accumulation sites), closed porosity increases rapidly, total number of pores increases at a greater rate, and the size of pores dramatically decreases (many small pores opposed to a few large open pores). Parameterizing pore close-off with both grain size and density, along with the layered nature of firn in firn densification models would improve their ability to accurately predict the LID and LIZ length.Firn air models should include an effective open porosity that accounts for differences in pore structure between high and low accumulation rate sites. An effective open porosity that reflects the pore structure of the site, not simply how much pore space is present, that correctly captures permeability in deep firn may provide better understanding of gas transport in the LIZ. An increase in the physical understanding of pore close-off in polar firn and its dependence upon local climate will enable more8 0   
accurate modeling under firn conditions with no present day analogue constraining the gas age/ice age difference.8 1   
6 ConclusionUnderstanding the influence of anthropogenic inputs on the Earth’s climate system first requires a base understanding of climatic fluctuations and abrupt climate change of the past. Of specific importance is the phasing between temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide during glacial-interglacial transitions. Accurate prescriptions of gas age and ice age at a given depth within an ice core are necessary because the air, the source of CO2 concentrations is always younger than the surrounding ice, the source of temperature. The ice age/gas age difference, Δage, is due to the process of air entrapment in the upper 100 meters of an ice sheet. The top 50-100m of an ice sheet consists of polar firn, a porous media spanning the densification ranges between snow and glacial ice. Polar firn essentially acts as filter smoothing atmospheric signals as air rapidly diffuses to the base of the firn column on a decadal scale (Sowers et al., 1992, Schwander et al., 1997). The magnitude of Δage is largely driven by the accumulation rate at a given site and thus understanding how accumulation rate and other local climate signals influence the microstructure, gas transport, and pore close-off within polar firn is of vital importance. The density, permeability and microstructure of two firn cores from different local climates, WAIS Divide and Megadunes, were examined. The microstructure of the firn, specifically the grain size and pore structure, was determined to have a significant impact on permeability and pore close-off that is not demonstrable directly through density variability.Antidunes (Megadunes) and their inhomogeneous nature of accumulation rate deposition, create a unique firn column with meter scale layering through the propagation down through the firn column of microstructural characteristics developed at the surface.8 2   
The alteration between past zero accumulation or ablating surface sites and accumulation sites provides a natural experiment independent of temperature in which past accumulation sites close-off earlier than firn densification models predict based on the average accumulation rate and temperature of the site. The presence of antidunes during glacial and glacial-interglacial transitions at very low accumulation sites in East Antarctica would decrease Δage adding additional constraints on the relationship between atmospheric CO2 and temperature.The physical characteristics of deep firn near the lock-in zone in deep firn at WAIS Divide and Megadunes gave a link between the gas transport properties and microstructural variability within polar firn. The open pore structure plays a more important role than density in predicting gas transport properties, through the porous firn matrix. For both WAIS Divide and Megadunes, fine grained layers experience close-off shallower in the firn column than do coarse grained layers, regardless of which grain sized layer is the more dense layer at depth. Pore close-off occurs at an open porosity that is accumulation rate dependent. Low accumulation sites, with coarse grains, close- off at lower open porosities (&lt;10%) than the open porosity (&gt;10%) of high accumulation sites with finer grains.At a given density, Megadunes firn pore structure was less complex and tortuous and therefore resulted in higher permeabilities than WAIS Divide firn, characterized by smaller grains and a more complex pore structure. The depth and length of the lock-in zone is primarily dependent upon accumulation rate and microstructural variability due to differences in grain size and pore structure, rather than the density variability of the layers. The pore close-off process should start with fine grained layers and progress with8 3   
depth toward coarse grained layers. The greater the variability between fine and coarse grain layers, the larger the depth interval this would happen over. Typically high accumulation sites show more layering at depth than low accumulation sites leading to long lock-in zones under high accumulation conditions (Landais et al., 2006, Horhold et al., 2011). Characterization of the lock-in zone based on firn microstructure and density at depth should improve firn densification models.A proposed way to incorporate the findings of this thesis into firn densification models is to determine the lock-in depth based on the finest grained firn reaching a site and grain size specific close-off density and to determine the close-off depth based on the coarsest grained firn reaching a second site and grain size specific close-off density. Therefore two critical close-off densities should be established at each site based on the local climate and extent of microstructure variability at depth.Implications for forward, physics based firn air modeling derived from this work include establishing an effective open porosity profile from the densification profile that is accumulation rate dependent. As low accumulation leads to a longer residence time in the near surface, coarser grains will be developed enhancing gas transport at a given density in deep firn. The opposite holds true for high accumulation sites, whose grains remain small leading to a complex, tortuous pore structure that dampens gas transport. Improving forward based model should reduce the need for inverse modeling and increase the confidence of firn air modeling when firn air measurements are not plausible. Relating pore close-off to microstructure at both WAIS Divide and Megadunes has enabled an accumulation rate, grain size dependent understanding of the lock-in zone. Application of these findings on the pore close-off process in polar firn could reduce the8 4   
data-model mismatch during glacial periods and glacial-interglacial transitions if antidunes were present, improve modeling of the lock-in zone through firn densification models, and reduce the need for inverse firn air modeling.8 5   
7. Future WorkFuture work should be divided into two main focus areas:1. Antidunes, specifically chemistry and impurity analysis on the dunes as they propagate down the firn column and become glacial ice. While antidunes have the potential to decrease Δage in the past, establishing a signature for antidunes that is maintained in deep ice cores is necessary for the application of a shallow LID.2. Examination of sites from a wide variety of local climates in order to further develop the dependence of gas transport and pore close-off on pore structure, grain size, and climatic condition.8 6

            <Text>INTRODUCTION
Even with the surge in use of renewable energy, for the foreseeable future the primary energy source for power applications is likely to be fossil fuels, particularly with the low price of natural gas. Using these resources as efficiently as possible for both economic reasons and to minimize carbon dioxide emissions is critical (Viswanathan and Bakker, 2000; Viswanathan et al., 2005). In order for power plants to be more efficient they need to run at higher temperature: an operating temperature increase from 873 K to 1073 K would increase the efficiency from &lt;40% to &gt;50%, and reduce CO2 emissions by 40-50% (Smith and Shoemaker, 2004).  This requires materials that are strong enough, can withstand an environment that may contain impurities in addition to steam, display good oxidation and corrosion resistance and are economically viable (Viswanathan et al., 2005). The Department of Energy-defined goal for alloys for the next-generation Advanced Ultra Supercritical (AUSC) steam plants is 35 MPa at 1033 K, which are the conditions that we will focus on in this proposal.  Affordable materials that can satisfy these requirements will also likely find use in supercritical CO2 cycles and in tubing for concentrated thermal solar power. 
The martensitic/ferritic alloys that are currently used in power plants are limited to operating temperatures ≤873 K (Viswanathan and Bakker, 2000).  Nickel-based superalloys, some titanium alloys, and, possibly, oxide-dispersion strengthened ferritic alloys (Miller et al., 2003, 2005) can satisfy the strength and, at least for nickel-based alloys, the oxidation and corrosion requirements at elevated temperatures.  Unfortunately, these materials are too expensive except for use in specialized applications (Takeyama, 2007). This critical need for advanced materials for steam turbine components in ultra supercritical power plants has been long recognized and is the basis of efforts in Japan, Europe, China, India and the U.S. (Viswanathan and Bakker 2000; Takeyama, 2007, Di Gianfrancesco, 2017).  
Recent efforts in this area have focused on devising new austenitic steels strengthened with Laves phases (Maziasz, 1989; Takeyama et al., 2001; Takeyama, 2007; Yamamoto et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2008), whose purpose is to provide a “grain boundary (GB) precipitation strengthening mechanism” (Tarigan et al., 2011, 2012). The addition of aluminum can be used to improve oxidation resistance in these alloys (Yamamoto et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b; Brady et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b). Such alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels have shown promise to decrease our reliance on expensive nickel-base alloys for aggressive conditions in energy production and chemical processing environments (Brady et al., 2014).  AFAs use alumina instead of chromia as a protective oxide scale for high corrosion resistance since it is known to offer even better protection at high temperatures (Kofstas, 1995; Heubner 2000).  AFA stainless steels were in development as early as the 1970s (McGurty, 1978) and, more recently, a new family of AFAs has been under development at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL (Yamamoto et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b, 2008, 2011; Brady et al., 2005, 2007a, 2008; 2014).  In the newer grades of AFAs, B2-structured NiAl and Laves phase precipitates are present on both the GBs and in the austenitic matrix, while MC precipitates or L12-structured Ni3Al precipitates, which are present only in the matrix, are used to increase the creep strength (Brady et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2008; 2011).  While great strides have been made in the properties of these AFA stainless steels, optimization of their creep strength and oxidation resistance with a balance of cost for future commercialization (Brady et al., 2014) has been difficult because the deformation behavior is poorly understood. 
This proposal is focused on the deformation behavior of these materials with an emphasis on elucidating the “grain boundary (GB) precipitation strengthening mechanism” (Tarigan et al., 2011, 2012). It will involve meticulous microstructural and defect characterization of the model AFA stainless steel Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al before and after mechanical testing using both a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In-situ straining studies will be performed in both a TEM and a SEM in order to elucidate both dislocation/precipitate and dislocation/GB interactions, including determining the role of the precipitate free zone present along the GBs. While most work will be performed at Dartmouth, TEM in-situ straining will also be performed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) through collaboration with Dr. Eric Stach, Group Leader, Electron Microscopy.

FURTHER BACKGROUND
Laves-Phase Strengthened Austenitic Stainless Steels
Takeyama et al. (2001) systematically studied Laves phase precipitation in the austenitic Fe-20Cr-(25-40)Ni-2Nb (in at. %) quaternary alloy system.  The precipitates, which adopt the hexagonal C14 structure, are often referred to as the  phase.  For alloys containing 35 at. % Ni, the precipitates are elongated with many interfacial dislocations, whereas for alloys containing 25 at. % Ni the precipitates are smaller and more equi-axed.  In these Fe-Cr-Ni-Nb alloys, the c/a ratio of the precipitates decreases as the Ni content decreases for 15-25 at. % Ni and changes little with further increases in Ni content.  At 25 at. % Ni the c/a ratio is about the same as that of binary stoichiometric Fe2Nb at 1.63, which is near the value for the cubic symmetry C15 Laves structure.  Although the precipitates are referred to by Takeyama (2007) as Fe2Nb, they contain 14-15 at. % Cr, 26 at. % Nb and 17-25 at. % Ni, depending on the overall alloy composition.  Takeyama (2007) determined TTT curves for the precipitates and found that precipitation at 1173-1273 K occurred first on the grain GBs after ~300 s, but only after &gt;1000 s in the matrix.  After long ageing times (4.32 x 106 s, i.e. 1,200 h) the precipitates on the GBs became significantly larger (≤ 3 µm).  
In contrast, Yamamoto et al. (2007b) found that the  Laves phase precipitates in the matrix of the alloy Fe-15Cr-20Ni-(1-2)Nb were relatively stable during both ageing and creep testing at 1073 K.  This stability may arise partly from the semi-coherent interface of the Fe2Nb precipitates, as indicated by the strain contrast present in TEM images even after long-term annealing (Takeyama, 2007), and also from the presence of small additions of Al, Mo, C and B.  Small elemental additions have also been shown to stabilize Laves phases in other systems: Maziasz (1989) noted that Si additions led to the formation of Fe2(Mo,Nb) precipitates in austenitic alloys, while Yamamoto et al. (2008) found that small Zr additions promote Fe2Ti Laves phase precipitates.
Yamamoto et al. (2008) studied the microstructural evolution of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb alloys with and without additions of 0.4 Si, 0.2 Zr or 5.0 Al (in at. %) during creep at 1023 K and 100 MPa.  The Si addition helped to both refine the particle size (from ~1 µm to 300 nm) and produce a greater volume fraction of particles during ageing at 1073 K, and stabilized them against coarsening, resulting in superior creep resistance.  Interestingly, alloys that were only solution treated showed superior creep properties to those that were aged prior to creep testing.  The authors speculated that this phenomenon was because the particles that were dynamically precipitated during creep were finer (300-400 nm) and, thus, more effective at pinning dislocations.  The Zr addition improved the creep resistance more dramatically than the Si additions possibly by stabilizing very fine -Ni3Nb particles.  The addition of Al not only improved the creep resistance due to the formation of 30 nm diameter Ni3Al precipitates, but also improved the oxidation through the formation of a protective alumina layer on the surface.
The fundamental issues with the use of austenitic alloys for high temperature applications were clearly articulated by Yamamoto et al. (2008) who noted that “The strengthening effect of Fe2Nb (Laves phase) strongly depends on its size and volume fraction, indicating that the thermal stability of the particle size and distributions is the key to improve creep properties.”  More specifically, the two key issues are that: 1) the increase in size and density of the large Laves phase particles that develop on the GBs during creep testing (Yamamoto et al. 2008) will ultimately result in specimen failure when the GB coverage of these brittle particles is large enough; and 2) further refinement of the Laves phase precipitates to ~100 nm dia. is necessary to improve the creep strength (Yamamoto et al., 2008).  
Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) examined the effect of boron (0.03%) on the creep strength of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (in at. %).  Both the boron-doped and boron-free alloys contained Ni3Nb precipitates (the ” phase at short annealing times and the  phase at long times) within the grains and Laves phase precipitates on the GBs. The boron decreased the creep rate and increased the creep rupture life by a factor of almost four. The role of boron appeared to be to increase the extent of the Laves phase precipitation at the GBs.  Simply aging the boron-free alloy to increase the extent of GB coverage by the Laves phase from 52% to 89% also increased the creep rupture life, and decreased the creep rate to a similar extent as the boron addition.  That even with 89% GB coverage by the Laves phase precipitates a creep rupture strain of 77% was attained shows that the precipitates do not necessarily embrittle the alloy. Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) found that the creep rate,, was related to the area fraction covered by the GB Laves phase, , according to: 
/0 (1- 					- (1)
0 is the creep rate when  = 0. This idea is similar to earlier observations that in a Ni-20Cr-20W alloy the minimum creep rate decreased linearly with increasing density of an intergranular 2 phase (Matsuo et al., 1987), and that increasing GB carbide precipitation in Ni-20 Cr and Fe-15Cr-25 Ni alloys increased their creep resistance (Zhang et al., 1987, 1989a, 1989b, 1991).  Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) suggested that the role of the GB phase was to suppress deformation at the GBs, whereas Zhang et al.’s (1989a, 1991) TEM observations suggested that the GB precipitation was associated with higher dislocation densities that strengthened the GB region.
Recently, Chen et al. (2014) also studied Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb with and without 0.03% B and found that boron both increased the extent of and produced finer Laves phase precipitates on the GBs, but by &lt;10% after their longest anneal of 24 h, when the GB coverage in the B-doped alloy was ~80%.  Using an EPMA, they showed strong boron segregation to the GBs.  They found that for both the boron-doped and boron-free alloy, longer aging times prior to creep testing increased the creep life (by up to 100% for a 4 h versus a 12 h anneal), and that for the same aging time boron doping increased the creep life (by up to 44% for short aging times but by less at long aging times) by producing greater GB coverage of the Laves phase.  Chen et al.’s (2014) results were very similar to those of Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012).  Boron’s role appears to be to reduce the annealing time to obtain a large GB coverage by the Laves phase. 

Alumina-Forming Austenitic Stainless Steels
Even within particular grades of AFAs, the influence of specific precipitates on creep strength is complex.  A wide variety of creep strengths can be obtained with relatively small changes in alloying elements, and phases that are beneficial in some AFAs appear to cause decreased creep strength in others.  There are three grades of AFAs that have been investigated by the ORNL group based on their nickel content (in wt. %), viz., 12Ni, 20-25Ni and 32Ni. The 12Ni grade alloys substitute Mn for some of the Ni both to stabilize the austenite relative to the deleterious –Fe phase and to lower the cost.  Unfortunately, this grade has been shown to have relatively poor creep resistance although the reason for the decreased creep strength is poorly understood (Brady et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2011).  In 20-25 Ni grade alloys it has been found that the total weight fraction of carbide phases is important.  For example, in a 20-25Ni grade alloy with 2.53 wt. % Nb and 0.2 wt. % C there was little MC supersaturation and it showed poor creep resistance compared to 25Ni grade alloys with 1 wt.% Nb and 0.1 wt. % C.  It is believed that the 2.53 wt.% Nb alloy showed poorer creep strength because the 2.53 wt.% Nb addition decreased the supersaturation of MC carbides (Brady et al., 2014).  The 1 wt. % Nb and 0.1 wt. % C additions have been shown to be the optimal amounts for MC carbide strengthening in other studies of AFAs as well (Brady et al, 2008; Yamamoto et al., 2009).  While increasing the Nb content from 1 wt. % to 2.5 wt. % seemed to have a detrimental role on the creep strength for a 25Ni alloy, in the 32Ni grade alloys with 3.3 wt. % Nb superior creep strength has been observed at 923 K, a feature that appears to be due to strengthening from L12 Ni3Al precipitates, producing a creep strength almost five times greater than the best carbide-strengthened 20-25 Ni alloy.  While the L12 Ni3Al improved the creep properties of the 32Ni alloy, at 923 K it is believed that the metastable L12 Ni3Al caused the decreased rupture time observed in a 25Ni-4Al-1Nb alloy with increased C content compared to a 25Ni-3Al-1Nb alloy. Although the creep strength was promising there was a tradeoff with significantly reduced creep elongation in the 32Ni grade alloy, which is thought to be due to σ-phase formation.  At 1023 K, the 32Ni alloy creep results were comparable to those of both the 20-25Ni and 12Ni alloy grades (Brady et al., 2014). 
Similarly, Dong et al. (2013) studied the creep behavior of Fe-19.95Ni-14.19Cr-2.25Al-2.26Mo-1.95Mn-0.15Si-0.01B (wt.%) at 973 K and 150 MPa and found that an alloy with 0.86 % Nb and 0.07 % C had poor creep behavior due to the relatively coarse (100 nm) NbC, whereas a similar alloy with a lower carbon content (0.04 %) had much smaller carbides (10 nm) and much improved creep properties. An alloy with the same carbon content but lower Nb (0.5%) and the addition of 0.2% V had even better creep properties due to the formation of (Nb,V)C.  Both Laves phase and NiAl were found to be present after the creep testing, but Dong et al. (2013) questioned whether they contributed to the creep strength.
32Ni grade alloys with decreased chromium content (14 wt. % versus 19 wt. %) and additional alloying elements such as Zr and Ti have less σ-phase formation and improved creep properties.  Indeed, a Zr, Ti alloyed 32Ni alloy with additions of carbon and boron was shown to have a creep-rupture life that exceeded that of the commercially-available Fe-base alloy A286 by an order of magnitude (Yamamoto, Muralidharan and Brady, 2013).  Boron improves the creep properties of AFA stainless steels, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Unlike the Al-free Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb alloy studied by both Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) and Chen et al. (2014), the addition of boron to a 32Ni grade alloy did not seem to have a significant effect on GB precipitation, and in this case it was hypothesized that the boron addition formed a strain field in the matrix that increased resistance to creep deformation (Yamamoto, Muralidharan and Brady, 2013).  It is worth noting that unlike the Al-free alloys in which a solutionizing anneal can completely dissolve the Laves phase precipitates, in the more complex alloys developed at ORNL solutionizing anneals still leave substantial volume fractions of the Laves phase in the material (Yamamoto, Muralidharan, Brady, 2013; Brady et al., 2014, Hu et al., 2014).
	While computational methods have helped in the design AFA alloys to limit the formation of deleterious phases, such as the sigma phase, and to help stabilize the austenitic matrix, it is clear that the additions of small alloying elements and their effect on the properties of AFA stainless steels require more detailed microstructural characterization. Even with an understanding of what phases may be present, creep mechanisms in this system are not well enough understood to predict which potential strengthening precipitate will be most beneficial for creep strength.  For many of the AFA alloys that were also tensile tested, the creep and elevated temperature tensile properties did not correlate well.  For example, in the 20-25 Ni grade alloys while B2-NiAl and Laves precipitation improves tensile properties, MC carbides appear to show a stronger influence on the creep strength (Brady et al, 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2011).  The ORNL group also questioned whether the Laves phase even had any significant influence on the creep strength (Bei et al., 2010). The lower tensile strength they observed in these alloys at 1023 K compared to room temperature appeared to be due to the softening of the B2 NiAl phase which produces significant strengthening at room temperature. This lack of correlation between the elevated temperature yield strength and the creep life is well illustrated in the data presented by Dong et al. (2013), see Table 1, although the strain hardening exponent, n, did show roughly the same trend as the creep life.

There has been little examination of the microstructure of specimens to failure.  However, a recent study of the ORNL alloy DAFA 29 (Fe-14Cr-0.1Mn-32Ni-0.1Cu-3Al-0.2Si-2.9Nb-2Ti-0.1Mo-0.3Zr-0.1C-0.1B) showed that creep failure after 5282 h under a stress of 100 MPa at 1023 K showed cracking around the GBs with some cracks passing through precipitates and others circumventing precipitates.  It is worth noting that it is unclear whether the crack path is exactly along the GB or whether it is really through the large precipitate free zone (PFZ) that is next to the GB.  Also, the imposed stress was three times the “design” stress for these alloys.

The Intellectual Merit of this Activity was to understand both the effects of deformation on the precipitation processes in Laves phase-strengthened austenitic steels, including determining the mechanism of NiAl co-precipitation, and how these two kinds of precipitates affect subsequent room-temperature deformation processes. In addition, some preliminary creep testing was performed on two home-built constant-stress creep rigs, based on a design by Garofalo, Richmond and Domis (1962).

The Broader Impacts of the Activity include the education of a female African-American Ph.D. student, Geneva Trotter (now employed at Applied Predictive Technologies), a female American M.S. student, Natalie Afonina, and eight undergraduates: Hughes Lee, Ryan Strain, Evan Schlick, Hailey Nicholson, Amaris De La Rosa-Morena (a minority student), Bingyue Wang, Yi (Annie) Sun and Reed Harder, with 

the four women undergraduates supported by Dartmouth’s Women in Science Program. The later two were co-authors on a journal paper. 


	Two observations in the work have broad applicability to alloy design in other systems: (1) cold work can lead to more rapid precipitation of a higher volume fraction of finer precipitates; and (2) even with almost complete coverage of the GBs by a brittle phase, extensive room temperature tensile ductility can still be achieved (see below). The work has been disseminated by the publication of six journal papers (Trotter et al., 2014a; Trotter and Baker, 2015a,b; Hu et al., 2013, 2015; Trotter et al, 2016), a paper recently submitted to a journal (Hu et al., 2016a), and through eleven conference presentations (Trotter, Rayner and Baker, 2012, 2013a, 2013b; Trotter et al. 2014b, 2014c; Hu, et al., 2014; Trotter and Baker, 2015c, 2015d, 2016; Baker et al., 2016; 2017).  The work involved collaborations with Drs. M.K. Miller and L. Yao (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), Drs. S. Chen and Z. Cai (Argonne National Laboratory) and Prof. P.R. Munroe (U. New South Wales, Australia).
Our work studied the effects of cold work on the simplified AFA stainless steel Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al - many of the alloys studied by the ORNL Group and others are much more complex containing 10 or so elements (Brady et al., 2014).  Cold rolling was performed, after solution treatment at 1523 K, to 25%, 50% and 90% rolling reductions with subsequent ageing performed for various times at 973 K, 1073 K and 1173 K. A significant density of dislocations was found in the matrix in the solutionized and aged specimens even without cold rolling, possibly due to the punching out of dislocations around the precipitates during cooling, see Figure 2. 
We found that cold work accelerated the precipitation kinetics of both the C14-type Fe2Nb-type Laves phase and the B2-type NiAl precipitates markedly compared to simply aging, presumably due to heterogeneous precipitation on dislocations, see Figure 3.  It is worth noting that in the material that was simply aged, the Laves phase precipitates nucleate before the B2 precipitates, but it is no longer clear that this sequence occurs after cold work and aging, see Figure 3.




While often co-located, the Laves phase and B2 particles are distinct. L12 (ordered f.c.c.) precipitates were also present in samples aged at 973 K with 90% prior cold work, but not in specimens annealed at 1073 K, which is in line with thermodynamic calculations, see Figure 4. The additional fine L12 precipitates present at 973 K are presumably the reason for the greater hardness of the 973 K annealed material (Trotter et al., 2014a). We have shown, using atom probe tomography, that the L12 precipitates in the ORNL-developed AFA steel DAFA 26 are Ni3(Al,Ti). Compared to material that had not been strained, defects introduced by cold work not only caused more rapid precipitation in the matrix but also increased the total volume fraction of precipitates as compared to material that had been simply aged, see Figure 3.  Histograms of the particle size distributions were produced for each annealing time and temperature (not shown here), and, as might be expected, they were lognormal with the particle size increasing steadily with increasing time and increasing temperature (Trotter et al., 2014a).


The orientation relationship between the Laves phase precipitates and the austenite matrix was found to be (0001)Fe2Nb || (111)γ :[1010]Fe2Nb || [110]γ (Denham and Silcock, 1969), while the B2 precipitates show the m // p, m // p Kurjamov-Sachs relationship (Trotter and Baker, 2015a).  





We also examined the effects of simply aging on the microstructure and room temperature tensile properties of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al and the results are dramatic, see Figure 5. Table 2 lists the average particle diameter for matrix and GB Laves and NiAl precipitates and the % GB coverage.



After solutionizing for 24 h at 1523 K the Laves phase precipitates had dissolved, see Figure 6. This material had a yield strength of 205 MPa, an elongation to failure of 52% and a low, uniform work hardening rate of ~300 MPa. A 2.4 h anneal at 1073 K, which produced substantial GB coverage of fine alternating Laves phase and NiAl precipitates but only a few small precipitates within the grains, gave a 57% increase in yield strength to 322 MPa with an increase in work-hardening rate, and a slight reduction in elongation to 37%. For this heat-treatment only there is a clear yield drop and a long Lüders region, see Figure 5.  Longer anneals increase the size and volume fraction of the precipitates both in the grain and on the GBs, and lead to almost complete coverage of the GBs after a 1325 h anneal, see Figure 6.

These changes increase the yield strength, work-hardening rate, and decrease the elongation, see Figure 5. The substantial increase in both yield strength and work-hardening rate for the longer anneals is consistent with Orowan looping around the precipitates within the grains, which produces substantial increases in dislocation density, including dislocation loops and dislocation dipoles.  Remarkably, even though the GBs are completely covered in brittle NiAl and Laves phase precipitates after the 1325h anneal, the material can still show 19% elongation!

We also performed tensile tests and preliminary creep studies at 1033 K on Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al given four of the heat treatments (0, 2.4, 24 and 240 h at 1073 K) used for the room temperature tensile tests shown in Figure 5. In the 1033 K tensile tests the alloy exhbited significantly lower elongations than at room temperature for all ageing times, see Table 3, with no work-hardening observed. As might be expected, the yield strengths were lower at 1033 K compared to room temperature, but surprisingly the material annealed for 240 h, which was one of the strongest when tested at room temperature, was even weaker than the solutionized material. In fact, the latter material was only slightly weaker at 1033 K than at room temperature, possibly due to some very fine precipitation during the test.
Creep tests at 1033 K showed that the 2.4 h and 24 h annealed specimens had similar secondary creep rates, although the 24 h annealed specimen had a slightly larger creep strain due to the greater initial primary creep, see Figure 7. This result is, perhaps, a little surprising since the particle sizes were significantly larger and the GB coverage significantly greater for the 24 h-annealed specimen, and no NiAl was detected on the GBs for the 2.4 anneal.  By comparison, the creep rate was significantly higher for the specimen annealed for 240 h, where particle sizes were larger still, but GB coverage was greater. Surprisingly, material tested in the solutionized condition (0 h anneal) shows a creep rate faster that of the 2.4 h and 24 h annealed material, but much slower than the 240 h annealed material. As shown in Figure 8, precipitation occurred in the solutionized Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al during creep testing, but this did not appear to affect the creep rate as testing continued.  In fact, since the aging temperatures were only 40 K above the creep test temperatures, the precipitate structure examined in all the crept specimens had clearly evolved compared to the uncrept specimens, see Figure 8. We also examined the heads of the crept specimens, which had seen the same temperature but not the stress seen by the guage of the specimens and the prceipitate structure in these had evolved in a similar way to the guage.
 
Figure 7. Creep curves for Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al at 1033 K and 35 MPa for specimens aged for different times at 1073 K.  Two tests were performed for each heat treatment. From Afonina and Baker (2016).

There are several interesting observations that can be made based on these preliminary creep studies. First, our results do not corroborate the observation made by others (Yamamoto et al. 2011; Dong et al., 2013; Brady et al., 2014) that the creep rate does not correlate well with the yield strength even if measured at the creep test temperature.  The creep rates in Figure 7 are clearly correlated with the yield strengths made at the same temperature (Table 3). Second, Yamamoto et al. (2008) found that solution-treated Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb showed superior creep properties to those for material aged prior to creep testing, possibly because the particles that were dynamically precipitated during creep of the solution-treated material were finer. While the latter precipitation phenomenon certainly occurs in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al, this did not lead to a lower creep rate than in material given the shorter (2.4 h, 24 h) ageing anneals. Third, the results do not validate the empirical equation determined by Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) and Chen et al. (2014) that the strain rate decreases with increasing coverage of the GBs by precipitates as shown inequation (1) since the 240-h heat treated material, which has the greatest GB precipitate coverage, shows a significantly higher creep rate than the 2.4 h and 24 h annealed material. A key difference from the work of Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) and Chen et al. (2014) is that in their work the GB precipitates were only Laves phase (since their alloys did not contain Al), whereas the alloy tested here has alternating Laves phase and B2 precipitates, and the latter will likely be softer than the matrix at the test temperature. Fourth, the results also do not agree with the suggestion by Dong et al. (2013) and Bei et al. (2010) that the Laves phase and NiAl do not contribute to the creep strength since the 2.4 h- and 24 h-annealed Laves phase and NiAl particle-containing material have lower creep rates than the particle-free material.
Scientific Questions
The Results from Prior Research along with the reviewed literature suggest three intriguing questions:
1.	How do gliding or climbing dislocations interact with the precipitates in austenitic AFA stainless steels both in the matrix and the GBs? In particular, how do the Laves, NiAl and Ni3Al precipitates’ size and spacing affect the creep strength of AFA stainless steels, and is the creep strength ultimately compromised by the PFZ?  
2.	How does the evolution of the precipitates under an applied stress at high temperature affect the deformation mechanisms?
3.	How can an alloy in which brittle Laves and B2 phases almost completely cover the GBs still show good room-temperature tensile elongation (~19%)? Intimately connected to this is the role of the PFZ.  









This proposal focuses on answering these questions.  The answers will not only provide the relevant understanding to develop improved AFA stainless steels, but will also be useful for other advanced alloys that are being developed which incorporate brittle intermetallics and GB strengthening phases that were often avoided in alloy design in the past. In other words, having obtained answers to these questions, can we utilize thermo-mechanical treatments to optimize precipitate distribution and the size of the PFZ in AFA steels to improve their mechanical properties?

The particles with light contrast are the Laves phase; the particles with dark contrast are NiAl. From Afonina and Baker (2016).

Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity
The aim and intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to ascertain the deformation mechanisms associated with GB precipitation strengthening, and to understand the fundamental deformation behavior in materials containing both a PFZ and multiple types of precipitates in both the GBs and the lattice each of which can contribute differently to the deformation behavior. The work will be performed on the model AFA stainless steel Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al with which we have considerable experience.

PROPOSED RESEARCH
The research proposed here will attempt to elucidate the strengthening mechanisms in AFA stainless steels, and, in particular, we will attempt to answer the questions posed above.  
Thus, we will:
1. Examine the dislocation structures in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al given different thermo-mechanical treatments and crept for different times.
2. Perform TEM in-situ straining experiments at room temperature and at 1033 K on both uncrept Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al and material crept for different times.
3. Perform SEM in-situ straining experiments at room temperature and at 1033 K on both uncrept Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al and material crept for different times.

	Figure 9 is a schematic outlining the overall approach to the proposed work. We will use the same material as that previously used for the creep and high temperature tensile tests, i.e. a press-forged 8 kg ingot of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al supplied by Mr. Michael Schmidt, CarTech Corporation. The microstructure of the model alloy being studied is shown schematically in Figure 10.  

Figure 9. Schematic outlining the approach to the proposed work















There are three features to this structure:
1.	Matrix precipitates: After elevated temperature annealing, the f.c.c. matrix contains fine coherent L12 Ni3Al precipitates, and larger B2 NiAl and Fe2Nb Laves phase precipitates. The Laves phase precipitates in the matrix nucleate before the B2 precipitates and, thus, for short annealing times it is possible to have only L12 and Fe2Nb Laves phase precipitates in the matrix.  All the precipitates coarsen upon annealing and the L12 precipitates may lose their coherency upon prolonged annealing.
2.	Grain Boundary precipitates: Upon annealing the GBs become covered in B2 and Laves precipitates, whose size and extent increases with annealing time until almost complete GBs coverage occurs.
3.	PFZ: At longer annealing times (240 h) a clear PFZ forms adjacent to the GBs. This region is potentially much weaker than the matrix and the GBs, and, thus, is a potential fracture path.  On the other hand, the easier flow in the PFZ may allow it to accommodate strains from the GB.

Creep Tests
As noted above, we have already performed preliminary creep tests at 1033 K to 600 h for as-solutionized (0 h) Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al and material annealed for 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h at 1073 K.  We will also perform constant-stress creep tests for shorter (100 h, 300 h) and longer times (1500 h, 3000 h or to failure) at 1033 K at a stress of 35 MPa. We have already loaded two specimens for the long-term creep tests, which will be ready for analysis should this proposal be funded.
To produce different amounts of GB coverage by the Laves phase and NiAl precipitates and different PFZ widths for similar precipitate distributions in the matrix, we will use two approaches.  First, we will cold roll material before ageing at 1073 K. This accelerates precipitation in the matrix but not in the grain boundaries (Trotter et al., 2014a), see Figure 3. Second, we will age material at lower temperatures.  This will lead to precipitation on the GBs, but less so in the matrix.  These additional specimens will allow us to separate effects associated with GB precipitation from effects due to matrix precipitation.
In monitoring the creep data, we will examine both the creep strain versus time (see, for example, Figure 7) and the creep strain rate versus creep strain. Analysis of the microstructures of specimens crept for different times (see below) will enable us to understand how the microstructure evolves over time and how this affects the creep behavior. These specimens will be used to make standard TEM and SEM specimens and TEM in-situ straining specimens,  

Microstructural Analysis
Microstructural characterization of the alloys will be performed both before and after testing. It is worth noting that the head of the creep specimens provides material that has seen the same temperature and time, but has not seen the stress of the creep specimen gauge, and so this provides a specimen that has simply been annealed. Thus, we will compare specimens take from the head with specimens taken from the gauge in order to understand what effect the applied stress has on precipitation (see Figure 8).  
	Backscattered electron imaging using a FEI XL30 field emission gun (FEG) SEM will be used to obtain the precipitate size distribution (frequency versus size) and spacing both within the grain and in the GB, as performed in Trotter et al. (2014a), see Figures 3 and 6. Diffraction-contrast transmission electron microscopy will be performed using a FEI Tecnai FEG 200 keV TEM to examine the precipitates in detail. A previous report on crept Laves-Phase-strengthened austenitic steels have suggested that the Laves phase precipitates become smaller during creep (Yamamoto et al., 2008). Both energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) will also be performed to clearly identify the precipitates.  Higher Order Lower Zone (HOLZ) line shifts in the transmitted disc in CBED patterns will be used to assess strains in the phases (Williams and Carter, 1996).

Deformation Mechanisms
Three approaches will be used to examine the deformation mechanisms.
Post-mortem TEM dislocation analysis will be performed on specimens crept at 1033 K and from room temperature tensile testing. Of particular interest is how changes in precipitate size and spacing affect the precipitate’s interactions with dislocations and whether greater GB precipitation is associated with increased dislocation densities in the GB region, as reported by Zhang et al. (1989a, 1991).

Two in-situ straining approaches (in-situ TEM, in-situ SEM) will be performed at both room temperature and 1033 K in order to examine the deformation mechanisms for a variety of precipitate sizes and spacings (see above). We will also perform some TEM in-situ straining experiments on crept specimens.

TEM in-situ Straining: TEM in-situ straining experiments will be performed at both room temperature and 1033 K on Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al with different particle sizes and spacings (see above) in order to observe the fundamental dislocation/precipitate interactions directly. It is worth noting that the P.I. has nearly 30 year’s experience with TEM in-situ straining experiments (Baker, Horton and Schulson, 1987; Baker, Schulson and Horton, 1987; Baker, Guha and Horton, 1993; Baker, and Horton, 1993; Baker et al., 1991; Baker and Liu, 1994; Horton, Baker and Yoo, 1991; Nagpal and Baker, 1991; Nagpal, Baker and Horton, 1994; Loudis and Baker, 2008; Liao and Baker, 2008, 2011a, 2011b), including recent work by Liao and Baker (2011a, 2011b) where TEM in situ straining observations at various temperatures up to 900 K were used to quantitatively explain the yield stress anomaly observed in Fe2MnAl.
Numerous features can be observed during TEM in-situ straining experiments including dislocation cross-slip, dislocation climb, dislocation pinning, and dislocation pile-ups. The curvature of dislocations can be used to estimate local stresses, e.g. Liao and Baker (2011a, 2011b), and the shift of HOLZ lines in the transmitted disc in CBED patterns will be used to assess local strains (Williams and Carter, 1996). TEM in-situ straining is not that useful for studying fracture per se since the fracture path in a thin foil may be different to that in the bulk (Baker, Horton and Schulson, 1987; Baker, Schulson and Horton, 1987).

SEM in-situ Straining: SEM in-situ straining experiments will be performed at both room temperature and 1033 K on Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al with different particle sizes and spacings in attempts to examine the fracture path, i.e. does it occur through GB precipitates, between the precipitates and the PFZ, or through the PFZ: the path may change depending on the heat treatment. The experiments will be performed on notched specimens so that we know in advance approximately where fracture will occur. The specimens will be recorded continuously during in-situ straining, but they will also be examined post-straining at high resolution. In addition to BSE imaging of the precipitates, electron channeling contrast imaging will be used to provide a view of the dislocation behavior after straining (Welsch et al., 2016). 

Mechanisms
It is worth considering what may happen during in-situ straining of an AFA steel. In general, at room temperature dislocations will cut through small coherent deformable particles, and loop around larger nondeformable particles (Orowan looping). The former produces a low work-hardening rate since once the particle is cut by a dislocation, passage of subsequent dislocations is easier.  Since the dislocation cuts the particle, the strength of the alloy is strongly dependent on the properties and dislocation behavior of the particle. For Orowan looping, the strength is strongly dependent on size and spacing but not on the mechanical properties of the particles. Examination of the stress-strain curves in Figure 5 suggests that particle cutting may be occurring in the material annealed for 2.4 h since this exhibits a low work-hardening rate (although considerably higher than that of the unannealed, particle-free material).  For longer annealing times, the substantially higher work-hardening rate suggest that Orowan looping is occurring, although one might expect the work-hardening rate to decrease with increasing annealing times as the particles increase in size and the interparticle spacing decreases.  


While this simple picture of particle cutting versus Orowan looping is appropriate for a material with a single type of precipitate, it may not be appropriate for the AFA steel studied here, which has three different precipitates. The Laves phase is not likely to deform at room temperature, and in the ORNL alloy DAFA 29 very large Laves precipitates, which are formed during the casting process, crack during room temperature deformation, see Figure 11. 


On the other hand, when the L12 precipitates are small, a/2 [101] dislocations gliding on a {111} slip plane will pile-up at the particle interface, and eventually glide through the precipitate in pairs of a/2 [101] dislocations-coupled by an anti-phase boundary (APB) on {111}, see Figure 12(a). This behavior occurs in some nickel-based superalloys and aluminum alloys containing L12 precipitates.  It might also be possible for dislocation cutting to occur in the B2 particles. As noted earlier, the m // p, m // p Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship was observed between the B2 particles and the f.c.c. matrix (Trotter and Baker, 2015a).  Slip typically occurs by a&lt;010&gt; or APB-coupled a/2&lt;111&gt; dislocations at room temperature in B2 compounds (Baker, 1995), with NiAl-based B2 compounds normally deforming by the glide of a&lt;100&gt; dislocations.  The a/2&lt;111&gt; dislocations gliding in the f.c.c. matrix might lead to a&lt;010&gt; or APB-coupled a/2&lt;111&gt; dislocations gliding in the B2 particles since the slip planes are aligned, see Figure 12(b,c).  As the L12 and B2 precipitates increase in size upon annealing, the deformation behavior will eventually change from dislocation cutting to Orowan looping.  However, the particle size at which this transition occurs will be different for different types of particles since it depends on the surface energies on the slip planes, the Burger’s vector and the shear modulus. For larger undeformable particles (≥ 0.1 µm), substantial local lattice rotations (up to ~45o) occur around the particles at larger deformations (Humphreys 1979), the local lattice rotations increasing with increasing particle size for a given strain.
A priori, it is not clear whether dislocation looping or particle cutting occurs in the three different precipitates, at what particle size particle the transition from cutting to looping occurs, whether one type of particle controls the strength or all contribute to the strength. We should also note the observation in Figure 2 that dislocations are punched out at the Laves phase particles due to the differences in thermal expansion between the particles and the matrix.  This may mean that gliding matrix dislocations do not encounter the particles per se, but interact with the dislocations around the Laves phase particles.
Turning to high temperature deformation, at elevated temperature cutting and looping can still occur, but, dislocations can also climb around precipitates (Honeycombe, 1984) and cross-slip around the precipitates becomes more likely (Smallman, 1985). It is worth noting that if dislocation cutting of the precipitates occurs, this can lead to mechanical dissolution of the precipitates and at elevated temperatures their re-precipitation. In other words, there are a greater number of possibilities of how deformation takes place at higher temperatures.















Regarding how this applies to the AFA steel, we do not know whether the L12 particles will get softer or harder with increasing temperatures as some L12 compounds such as Ni3Al can show a yield anomaly (Pope and Ezz, 1984; Liu and Pope, 1995). In contrast, the B2 precipitates would be expected to lose their strength at ~0.45 Tm, where Tm is the melting point, as is observed in B2 alloys (Baker 1995). Laves phases are brittle but they can show plastic flow under compression even at room temperature via a twinning mechanism involving synchroshear though the movement of 1/6&lt;211&gt; synchroshockley partials on the basal plane (Chu and Pope, 1993a,b; Hazzledine and Pirouz, 1993; Kumar et al, 2000; Kumar and Hazzledine, 2004; Chisholm, Kumar and Hazzledine, 2005; Takata et al., 2009, 2013a, b, 2016; Heggen, Houben and Feuerbacher, 2010; Yang et al., 2012).  Interestingly, Takata et al. (2013a) found both basal and non-basal slip occurred at a lower stress in Laves phase nanopillars, which had previously been nanoindented than in non-nanoindented nanopillars, suggesting that the difficulty of dislocation nucleation contributes to their normally brittle behavior. Chu and Pope (1993a,b) found plastic flow occurred at 1073 K, in a C15 Laves phase by ½&lt;110&gt; slip. Recent TEM observations of the ORNL alloy DAFA29 indicate that dislocation glide occurs within the Laves phase precipitates during straining at 973 K, see Figure 12. 
The creep curves in Figure 7 clearly indicate that the particles improve the creep rate, and that this improvement becomes less as the particles get bigger.  A key question is do all the particles contribute to the improved creep rate or only some of them, and do the deformation mechanisms change as the particles get bigger.  Also, can the B2 particles, which will be softer than the matrix, strengthen the material by trapping gliding matrix dislocations.




Thus far, we have only discussed the behavior of particles in the matrix, however, the Laves phase and B2 phase particles were originally added to AFA steels as GB strengtheners.  Thus, we will also examine the interaction of gliding dislocations with the B2 and Laves phase precipitates at the GBs. At room temperature, these phases are expected to be harder than the matrix and would be strong barriers to dislocation transmission. Of interest is whether dislocations impinging on the GB behave differently when they encounter a B2 precipitate rather than a Laves phase precipitate – as noted earlier, Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) suggested that the role of the GB Laves phase was to suppress deformation at the GBs, whereas Zhang et al.’s (1989a, 1991) TEM observations suggested that the GB precipitation was associated with higher dislocation densities that strengthened the GB region. Research on f.c.c./B2 lamellar structured FeNiMnAl alloys showed that initial yielding occurred in the softer f.c.c. phase, but that the B2 phase yielded once work hardening in the f.c.c. phase had increased its flow stress to the yield stress of the B2 phase (Liao and Baker, 2011). Also, for the shorter annealing time of 2.4 h only about half of the GB is covered in dislocations.  How does this affect the deformation at the GBs? 
During high temperature deformation, the GBs could be viewed quite differently.  Now, there is a hard Laves phase precipitate and a soft B2 precipitate.  Is this advantageous, or does deformation within the B2 particles caused strains at the GBs that cause the fracture.  This would be consistent with the lower fracture strains observed in tensile tests at 1033 K compared to room temperature, see Table 3.  An alternative is than strains generated at the GBs lead to punching out of dislocations in the nearby matrix. 
A further complication both for understanding both room temperature and elevated temperature deformation is the presence of a PFZ, which is quite pronounced in the AFA steel at longer annealing times. Nembach and co-workers (Baither et al., 2003; Krol et al., 2003) used in-situ TEM straining to study the interaction of gliding dislocations with the PFZ in the polycrystalline gamma-prime strengthened nickel-based superalloy Nimonic PE16. They found that the PFZ reduces the yield strength only if the width of the PFZ’s exceeds 1.7( - r), where is interparticle spacing and r is radius of the L12 particles. For widths greater than this, dislocations are generated in the PFZ itself and the resulting dislocation pile-ups lead to a yield strength reduction.  Thus, a question regarding the PFZ is whether this acts differently than the matrix, allowing significantly more strain there since it is softer than the matrix.
The TEM in-situ straining studies will be performed on Dartmouth’s Tecnai FEG TEM for which the P.I. has a Gatan single-tilt, hot-straining stage (operates to 1273 K) and a video system. It is important to correlate the in-situ straining experiments with the post-mortem TEM analysis. The latter can provide Burgers vector information, but always has the possibility that the dislocations have rearranged themselves (particularly after high temperature deformation) so that one does not see the real line direction of the gliding dislocations. These studies will benefit from the utilization of a first-of-its-kind direct electron detector at BNL, which allows capture of in-situ videos at unprecedented time resolution, with full resolution data obtainable at up to 1600 frames/sec. BNL personnel also have considerable experience with TEM in-situ straining experiments. It is worth noting that while the macroscopic loading rates in both of these set-ups can be varied, control is not precise enough to determine strain rate sensitivities.

Analysis of the Results
Rösler and Artz (1990) developed a model to predict the creep rate for a particle-containing material. However, this is for a single type of hard undeformable, typically oxide, particle in which the rate controlling mechanism is breaking away from the particle after the dislocation has largely bypassed it (Schröder, and Arzt, 1985; Czyrska-Filemonowicz et al., 1995; Häussler et al., 2001). The model does not consider GB particles. Zhang et al.’s (1991) creep model attempts to separate the strengthening from precipitates in the grain from those in the GB but again includes only one type of undeformable particle.  Neither model incorporates the possibility than softer particles may strengthen the material.  While the primary goal of the proposed work is not model development, we will attempt to develop a model based on our experimental observations. What form this will take is difficult to say. It is worth noting that the P.I. has experience in developing deformation models e.g. on the role of both GBs and particles on the ductility of intermetallic compounds (Baker and Schulson, 1989; Baker, 1999); a well-accepted model for the yield anomaly in FeAl (George and Baker, 1998); and a model for strain-induced ferromagnetism in intermetallic compounds (Yang, Baker and Martin, 1999; Wu, Munroe and Baker, 2003).  

Personnel/Budget/Timeline
The project will run for three years with a starting date of September 1st, 2017. The P.I., a Ph.D. student and a number of undergraduates, typically two per year, will perform the work. Funds are requested for graduate student support, partial support of the P.I., travel, TEM/SEM time and supplies. 

BROADER IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED ACTIVITY
The results from this work will help to elucidate the deformation behavior of AFA stainless steels by understanding the interactions between dislocations and the precipitates. This will help not only in the future design of AFA steels but in understanding deformation in commercial alloys such as Crofer 22H (Barrilao, Kuhn and Wessel, 2016) and in several alloys being developed (Kuhn et al., 2016; Yamamoto et al, 2016; Takeyama, 2007; Tarigan et al., 2011, 2012) in which Laves phase precipitates are present in both the matrix and cover the grain boundaries and a PFZ is present. It will elucidate whether brittle GB precipitates are useful to incorporate in alloys for creep strengthening, and if the inclusion of precipitates that are softer than the matrix can improve creep behavior. It will attempt to understand why substantial tensile ductility is possible even when the GBs are covered with brittle phases, which will aid in their incorporation in other alloys systems. Finally, it will aid in designing and understanding the deformation behavior of novel alloys that contain multiple types of precipitates with different properties. The deliberate incorporation of brittle intermetallic compounds represents a paradigm shift in alloy design.
The project will also lead to the training of a number of undergraduates and a Ph.D. student.
Promoting graduate training: At the end of the project, in addition to the knowledge from formal coursework, the Ph.D. student will have gained skills in mechanical testing and materials characterization. For professional development, the student will take the Teaching Science seminar offered by Dartmouth's Center for the Advancement of Learning. All graduate students are required to undertake Dartmouth’s Ethics training program. The P.I. will support and encourage the student to attend professional development workshops such as the Teaching Science seminar and the Communicating Research workshop series offered through Dartmouth's Center for the Advancement of Learning (DCAL), which was attended by the student on the current project. Dartmouth’s Outreach Office works with DCAL to integrate these trainings with opportunities for hands-on application through science outreach in local schools, such as lunch-time Science Cafes where graduate students have informal conversations with middle school youngsters about their fields, and Science Pubs, in which community members and researchers have lively conversations about science topics. DCAL does formative assessments of its graduate student professional development programs for continuous quality improvement; outcomes of our Ph.D. program are assessed through both a Thayer School survey and an on-line survey for comparison with other institutions.  Ph.D. students have an exit interview with the Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs.
Innovation: Thayer School of Engineering offers a Ph.D. Innovation Program designed to teach students the skills needed to be effective in the innovation process.  Innovation Ph.D. fellowship funding is available after a student’s 3rd year. We expect that the graduate on this project will join this program.
Integrating research and teaching: The P.I. expects to have two undergraduates assist on the project each year funded by NSF REU funds, Dartmouth’s nationally honored Women in Science Project (WISP) and possibly a student (male or female) funded by the Thayer School’s First Year Research in Engineering (FYRE) program that started in 2015. They will gain laboratory and research experience and will be required to take both laboratory safety and ethics training before starting their research. Typically, the PI has 5-6 undergraduates per year who work with graduate students on funded projects. They are typically supported by WISP, FYRE or by NSF REU funds. The Ph.D. student will share responsibility for mentoring the undergraduates, whose research on this project will integrate closely with their own. The undergraduates will take both laboratory safety and ethics training before beginning research. Minorities and, particularly, women have been well represented in amongst undergraduate participants.
Broadening participation: Dartmouth courts minority students at all degree levels, and we will encourage women and members of minority groups to apply for the graduate student position on this project. The Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College will pay for the travel to Dartmouth of any suitable applicants. Currently 38% of Ph.D. students at Thayer School are female and 50% of the P.I.’s graduate students are women; at the undergraduate level 52% of 2016 graduated engineering majors at Dartmouth were female! The P.I. has a track record of successfully mentoring women students through participation in institutional programs such as Dartmouth’s WISP program and will build on this experience (the PI has a fifteen-year WISP participation award). WISP, which has been successful in improving retention rates of women in science and engineering at Dartmouth, emphasizes student research experience. In addition to encouraging broader participation of women in science and engineering, this type of hands-on, interactive, contextual and collaborative learning has been shown to encourage participation of other underrepresented groups (Green et al. 2000; Goodman 2002; Lopatto, 2007; Hunter, Laursen and Seymour, 2007). 
Broad dissemination: In addition to publishing the results of the research in refereed journals and presenting them at conferences, we will work with the Science Writer in Dartmouth’s Office of Public Affairs to disseminate new findings on Dartmouth’s web site and to the news media as appropriate. In addition, material developed in this work will be used in a graduate course on Materials Characterization.

IntroductionThe materials needed for energy applications have traditionally been those that maximize efficiency and decrease costs. Alumina- forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels have shown promise to decrease reliance on expensive Ni-base alloys for aggressive conditions in energy production and chemical processing environ- ments [1]. AFAs use alumina as a protective oxide scale for high corrosion resistance instead of chromia; alumina is known to offer even better protection than chromia at high temperatures [2,3]. AFA stainless steels were in development as early as the 70s [4] and more recently a new family of AFAs has been developed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) [1,5–8].The newer grades of AFA stainless steels have an austenitic matrix, which provides better high-temperature creep strength than a b.c.c. matrix, and either MC or γ0-Ni3Al precipitates provide creep strengthening [1,7,8]. AFA stainless steels, which exist over a wide compositional range, have shown promising results but further study is needed to find the optimum combination ofn Correspondence to: 14 Engineering Drive, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH 03755, USA.

All rights reserved.abstractThe effect of aging on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of an alumina-forming austenitic stainless steel, Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al (at%) has been investigated. The alloy was fully solutionized after a 1250 1C, 24 h heat treatment, and the precipitation of B2 and Laves phases was studied after aging at 800 1C for up to 1325 h. While after 24 h the Laves phase precipitates in the matrix were 205 nm in diameter, they showed a further increase in diameter of only 50 nm even after aging for 1325 h. In contrast, the B2 precipitates in the matrix grew at a faster rate: after first being observed after aging for 24 h at an average diameter of 194 nm, they more than doubled in size from 330 to 734 nm as the aging time increased from 240 h to 1325 h. Both the Laves and B2 precipitates in the grain boundaries grew at a faster rate and were larger than matrix precipitates. The grain boundary coverage at 2.4 h (Laves 192 nm, NiAl 126 nm) was 56% with Laves phase initially making up the bulk of the precipitates, but after 2.4 h Laves phase and B2 precipitates alternated on the grain boundaries and total coverage reached 93% after 1325 h. An increase in the volume fraction of precipitates in the alloy was accompanied by an increase in the yield strength from 205 MPa after the solutionizing treatment up to 383 MPa after aging at 800 1C for 1325 h. After aging for 1325 h, even with extensive intermetallic grain boundary coverage, the alloy showed a room temperature elongation of 19%.￼￼￼&amp; 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Even within particular grades of AFAs, the influence of precipitate phases on creep strength is complex and a wide variety of creep strengths can be obtained with relatively small changes in alloying elements and phases [1,9,10].Laves phase precipitates are potential candidates for strength- ening AFA stainless steels. The AB2-type Laves phase generally comes in one of three forms: hexagonal MgZn2 (C14), cubic MgCu2 (C15) or hexagonal MgNi2 (C36) [11]. Even though Laves phase has been shown to be harmful in some ferritic steels [12], decreasing their toughness and strength and precipitating at the grain boundaries, some research has indicated their potential for strengthening in both AFA stainless steels and alloys with similar compositions [7,10,13–16]. Use of the C14 Fe2Nb as a strengthener in an AFA steel is advantageous because it has a high melting temperature of 1641 1C, exists in equilibrium with f.c.c. γ-Fe to temperatures above 9551C [13,17], and has shown long-term stability at high temperatures [7,16–18]. Some previous studies have looked to Laves phase particles for strengthening in AFA-type alloys, but have only seen low or moderate improvements in creep resistance [7,16]. There was a slight improvement in creep resistance at 750 1C and 100 MPa in an AFA steel when the niobium content increased from 1 to 2 at% but the improvement￼￼
was small when compared to the effect of increased carbon content. There was some dislocation pinning by coarse 500 nm size Fe2Nb precipitates and 10-nm size MC carbide precipitates but it was not clear whether the combination of precipitates was better than strengthening by MC carbide alone [16].In the present work, the effects of heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of an alumina-forming austenitic stainless steel, Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al (at%) have been investigated. We show that, despite extensive intermetallic cover- age of the grain boundaries, surprisingly, the material was able to show both good ductility and strength.2. Experimental15.24 cm long, 2.54 cm diameter ingots of Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb– 5Al (at%) were arc melted followed by drop casting into a copper crucible, courtesy of Dr. Easo P. George at ORNL. The as-cast alloy was homogenized in argon for 24 h at 1250 1C and water quenched. This homogenization treatment produces a single phase material [19]. Samples were subsequently aged in air for 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h, 480 h and 1325 h at 800 1C.A FEI XL-30 field emission gun (FEG) scanning electron micro- scope (SEM) operated at 15 kV and equipped with energy dis- persive spectroscopy (EDS) was used for microstructural analysis. Samples were prepared for SEM analysis by polishing with successively finer grits of silicon carbide paper, up to 1200 and with 0.3 and 0.05 mm alumina powder in a water to obtain a mirror finish. Backscattered electron (BSE) images from the speci- mens were processed using ImageJ [20] using a routine described in a previous paper [19] that uses Z-contrast to distinguish precipitates.Transmission electron microscope (TEM) specimens were pre- pared by cutting discs out of samples that had been milled into 3 mm cylindrical rods. These discs were mechanically thinned and polished to $ 100 mm thick and electropolished using a Struers TenuPol-5 twin-jet electropolisher at a voltage of 11 V with a current of $ 180 mA using an electrolyte of 25% nitric acid in methanol at  20 1C. An EDS-equipped FEI Tecnai FS20ST FEG TEM operated at 200 kV was used to examine specimens.Flat, dog-bone tensile specimens approximately 1.27 mm thick, with an overall length of 12.7 mm, and gauge length of 9.5 mm were prepared by milling followed by sectioning on a high-speed saw. The specimens were polished up to 1200-grit SiC paper and finished with 0.3 mm alumina powder to eliminate surface defects. Tensile tests were conducted in air at room temperature using an MTS at an initial strain rate of 5 10 4 s 1. Up to four tests were performed for each aging condition. Samples were preloaded to $150 N prior to testing. Percent elongation was determined from measurements of the specimens taken before and after fracture using an optical microscope. True strain (ε) and true stress (σ) were calculated from the load–displacement data and the work- hardening exponent was determined using the Hollomon equation [21]: σ1⁄4K(ε)n, where K is the strength coefficient that is equal to the true stress when ɛ1⁄41, and n is the strain-hardening exponent. This equation can be rewritten log(σ)1⁄4log(K)þn log(ε). Thus, by plotting log(σ) versus log(ε) for the uniform plastic deformation range, and fitting a straight line to the data, n can be determined from the slope, i.e. n1⁄4d log(σ)/d log(ε). For materials with inho- mogeneous yielding, the plastic portion is considered starting from the lower yield point.Image analysis was performed previously on particles in this alloy system that were aged up to 240 h [19]. The analysis was extended to samples that had been aged for 1325 h. The particle nearest-neighbor distance, λ was determined for each aging conditionfrom the following equation [22]: λ 1⁄4 12 ð P A Þ   1 = 2where PA is the particle density or point density and is equal to the particle count divided by the area of the image field of view [23]. Grain boundary coverage was calculated using BSE images. The percent coverage was found by subtracting segments of the grain boundary devoid of Laves and NiAl precipitates from the total grain boundary length and then dividing by the total grain boundary length.X-ray diffraction (XRD) was also performed on bulk samples using a Rigaku D/Max 2000 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ1⁄40.154059 nm) at 40 kV and 300 mA from 201 to 1201 with a step size of 0.011 with a count time of 1 s per step.3. Results and discussionAfter solutionizing at 1250 1C the alloy is single phase austenite (f.c.c.) and after aging at 800 1C both Laves and NiAl phases are present [19]. Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of the evolution of C14- type Fe2Nb and B2-ordered NiAl precipitates in the austenitic matrix after a 1250 1C, 24 h solution heat treatment and subse- quent aging at 800 1C for 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h, and 1325 h. X-ray peaks corresponding to C14 and B2 phases were not clearly visible until 24 and 240 h, respectively.Fig. 2 shows BSE images of the microstructures after the 1250 1C solution heat treatment and after aging at 800 1C for 0.5 h, 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h, and 1325 h; the phase showing the light contrast is the C-14 type Fe2Nb and the darker phase is the B2- structured NiAl. These precipitates are common in AFAs [1,5,6,9,24–29]. Fig. 2(b) shows that precipitation of the Laves phase occurs on the grain boundaries even within 30 min at 800 1C. Fig. 2(c) shows that after aging for 2.4 h at 800 1C NiAl precipitation accompanies the Laves phase precipitation on the grain boundaries, however, the Laves phase precipitates make up a majority of the grain boundary precipitates and are coarser than the Laves phase precipitates in the grain interior. After aging for 24 h (Fig. 2(d)) the Laves and NiAl precipitates have increased in size in the matrix and the NiAl grain boundaries and the amount of NiAl on the grain boundaries is now similar to the extent of Laves phase coverage. Fig. 2(e) shows that at 240 h the NiAl precipitates have significantly increased in size in the matrix compared to the Laves phase, but on the grain boundaries the Laves and NiAl particles are comparable in size. After aging for 1325 h (Fig. 2(e)) larger Laves phase particles are present in the matrix, and the size of the NiAl particles has also increased. As the aging timeFig. 1.

The light precipitates are the Laves phase and the dark precipitates are the B2 phase.increased, a precipitation free zone (PFZ) becomes evident on the grain boundaries and increases in size. The formation of the precipitate free zone with longer aging is not surprising since the grain boundaries and matrix precipitates are made up of the same solute atoms [30]. In a 60 mm grain sized sample of Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al (at%) that was examined after creep-rupture testing at 750 1C and 100 MPa, a γ0-PFZ was formed that was postulated to have caused low creep-ductility. It was suggested that coarsening the grain size or using directional solidification to reduce the total grain boundary area might improve creep properties [7].Table 1 shows the average Laves and NiAl particle sizes both on the grain boundaries and within the matrix at each aging condi- tion.

aging up to 240 h were reported in [19] and are duplicated in the Table. The Laves phase particles in the matrix after 24 h nearly doubled in size (205 nm) compared to the size at 2.4 h (95 nm). The Laves phase precipitates on the grain boundaries are 192 nm after aging for 2.4 h and show continued growth up to 743 nm after 1325 h. The NiAl particles are not visible in the matrix after 2.4 h, but appear on the grain boundaries (126 nm) and are slightly smaller than the Laves phase grain boundary precipitates (192 nm). Once NiAl precipitation is observed in the matrix at 24 h, the particle size continues to increase for aging times up to 1325 h: at 240 h the NiAl particle size (323 nm) is larger than that of the Laves phase (252 nm). At 240 h the grain boundary NiAl particles (366 nm) are also larger than the Laves phase particles on the grain boundaries (252 nm) and they continue to grow at a faster rate than the Laves phase grain boundary particles for aging up to 1325 h. After 1325 h the Laves phase particles showed growth to 301 nm in the matrix and the NiAl matrix particles had increased to 734 nm. In a Fe–20Cr–15Ni–5Al (at%) base alloy [16] the authors noted that after 2160 h at 800 1C there was not much change in the microstructure indicating good thermal stability. This thermal stability has also been noted after 2012 h at 750 1C in other AFA alloys [18].Table 2 shows how the area fraction of grain boundary pre- cipitates changes with time. While there is no grain boundary coverage without aging, after 2.4 h there is 56% grain boundary coverage. There is much more variability in grain boundary cover- age after aging at 2.4 h. There is significant grain boundary coverage of 78% after 24 h and 84% after 240 h. After 1325 h the grainTable 2Area fraction of grain boundary Laves and NiAl precipitates, room temperature yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and elongation to failure, εf, and strain-hardening exponent, n (with two n values in the case of two-stage work hardening), calculated over the uniform plastic range as a function of aging time at 800 1C for Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al (at%).boundary was almost completely saturated with 93% coverage. At the early stages of aging, the amount of grain boundary precipitation significantly varies depending on the grain boundary misorientation. This is consistent with Denham and Silcock's observation that the size and density of the Fe2Nb precipitates can show variations based on the crystallography of the grain boundary [31]. In the present alloy, as the grain boundary pre- cipitates grew in size as the sample was aged, the boundaries that had less coverage initially were able to ‘catch up’ which led to increased grain boundary coverage as the sample was aged.Fig. 3(a) is a bright field TEM image showing dislocations surrounding the Laves phase precipitates. Dislocations can be punched out due to the strains arising from the difference in the thermal expansion between the precipitate and matrix. The dislocations formed from the precipitation of the Laves phase then act as sites for further Laves phase precipitation and can result in the formation of stringers [30]. Evidence of precipitation in this manner is visible in the BSE image shown in Fig. 3(b) where in one grain, there are lines of precipitates that have presumably precipitated on punched out dislocations. The strain contrast that is present in TEM images of Fe2Nb that has precipitated in austenite in Fe–20Cr–35Ni–2Nb and Fe–20Cr–25Ni–2Nb (at%) after aging at 800 1C [17] is indicative of a semi-coherent pre- cipitate-matrix interface and may be a reason why the Laves phase has shown stability during aging and creep testing at 800 1C [32]. If the precipitate had a different crystal structure than the matrix it would be expected to form a needle-like or disk-like nucleus [33].Tensile testing showed that the strength and ductility of the alloy was strongly influenced by the aging time and, hence, the formation and coarsening of the precipitates. Increasing the aging time led to an increase in tensile strength, but a decrease in ductility, see Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows BSE images of the fracture surfaces after tensile testing, which all displayed dimple-type ductile rupture irrespective of the measured elongations. The trends of decreased ductility and improved strength with ageing observed here have been noted in other AFA alloys aged at 750 1C [18]. In AFA alloys with base composition Fe–(11.90–14.24)Cr–1.93Mn– (20.10–25.24)Ni–(0.47–0.48)Cu–(2.87–3.91)Al–14Si–(1.01–1.00)Nb– (2–2.01)Mo–(1–0.99)W (wt%) yield strength and ultimate tensile strength reached maximum values (400–450 and 890–930 MPa respectively) after 50 or 500 h aging and the yield strength did not show much change, while the ultimate tensile strength slightly decreased. Among the AFA alloys tested, elongation continuously decreased with aging regardless of composition [18]. In contrast to0 205 56 322 78 362 84 351 93 383338 52 502 37 707 29 715 28 736 19G.

This yield-point phenomenon has been studied extensively in steels and is known to occur when dislocations quickly multiply and the average dislocation velocity decreases along with the stress needed to move dislocations [34– 36]. A summary of the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation for each aging condition is presented in Section 2. When an upper and lower yield strength was observed, the lower yield strength is presented.Figs. 6 and 7 show representative plots of the strain hardening exponent fit for the different aging conditions. The n value can range from 0 to 1 with typical values being from 0.1 to 0.6 [37]. In Fig. 6 the double logarithmic plot of the true stress and true strain for the solutionized alloy did not show a good straight line fit, while linear fits with R2 values close to 1 were obtained for aging times of 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h and 1325 h (Fig. 7), i.e. except for the as- solutionized alloy, all the other specimens could be well described by the Hollomon equation. Hollomon noted that there were cases where the log–log plots of stress and strain can curve upward, especially for larger strains, suggesting anisotropy [21]. The homogenized, non-aged alloy showed the largest elongation. Fig. 6 shows that this alloy displayed two-stage work hardening also known as ‘double n’ behavior. The curve is deconvoluted to show two stages of work-hardening with the first curve showing a small n-value of 0.18 followed by a second stage showing a high n value of 0.70. The representative log–log plots in Fig. 7 for samples aged at 2.4h, 24h, 240h and 1325h show a good match to the Holloman equation all with R2 values of 0.99. Samples aged atFig. 4. Representative tensile curves of Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al (at%) solutionized at 1250 1C for 24 h and subsequently aged at 800 1C for different times as indicated. At least three tests were performed for each condition.2.4 h showed the highest work-hardening exponent with n 1⁄4 0.62. This is most likely due to the effects of discontinuous yielding. The n value for steels typically decreases with increasing strength. The highest possible n value of a steel is when its strength is the lowest and n tends to increase with elongation [38]. In the present study, n-values after aging at 24 h, 240 h and 1325 h were $0.3. The strain hardening values are summarized in Table 2.Fig. 8 shows a linear fit to a plot of the inverse mean surface-to- surface interparticle spacing versus the yield strength, which produces the equation σy (MPa)1⁄474λ 1þ202 where λ is the mean interparticle spacing. The predicted value of the yield strength from this equation without any particles at 202 MPa is closely similar to the experimentally-measured value of 205 MPa. The result is indicative of a looping mechanism of particle strengthening. An Orowan looping-based mechanism would make sense for the Laves phase precipitates because they are hard and brittle and would act as a barrier to dislocation motion [18]. The model does not, however, completely capture the results obtained. The largest YS and UTS were observed after 1325 h, not after 24 h when the smallest interparticle spacing was observed.It is possible that the greater grain boundary coverage at 1325 h is what caused the alloy to show both higher yield and tensile strength even as the matrix particles coarsened and the inter- particle distance increased. Tarigan et al. reported that creep life was extended without ductility loss even with increased Laves phase grain boundary precipitation in Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb (at%) [14,15] and called the strengthening mechanism a “grain boun- dary precipitation strengthening mechanism” (GBPS) which theyFig. 6.

The 93% grain boundary coverage at 1325 h, coupled with the more than doubling and tripling of grain boundary precipitate size at 24 h for the Laves and NiAl, respectively led ductility to decrease by $1/3.Even with the grain boundaries being nearly completely saturated with precipitates of brittle phases, the alloy had ductility of 19% after 1325 h. If the two phases are relatively coherent with the grain boundary, it would be expected that a favorable combination of creep and ductility could be attained [39]. For example, data from Keown and Pickering's on AISI type 347 stainless steels in 1974 [40] suggested that the Fe2Nb on grain boundaries might have improved creep ductility, but Kestenbach and Bueno [39] presented evidence that disproved this. They also cited that Fe2Nb precipitation caused decreased ductility in the high temperature tensile tests performed by Denhan and Silcock [31]. However, in Bei et al.'s more recent study of AFAs, even though the ductility decreased with aging, it was still 10–15% in room temperature tensile tests after aging for 2012 h, even though there was extensive grain boundary coverage of both NiAl and Laves phases [18]. Tarigan et al. [14,15] observed that even with 89% grain boundary coverage by the Laves phase precipitates a creep rupture strain of 77% was attained which suggests that Laves phase grain boundary precipitates do not necessarily lead to deleterious embrittlement.

In Chen et al.'s study of Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–0.03B (at%) it was also con- cluded that precipitation of the Laves phase on the grain bound- aries enhanced creep resistance [10]. These alloys did not include additions of Al so instead of just Laves phase, both Laves and NiAl precipitates are present on the matrix and grain boundary. Con- sistent with the results involving creep, the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength maximum at 1325 h in Fe–20Cr–30Ni– 2Nb–5Al (at%) reflects the condition of maximum grain boundary coverage, indicating that the increased grain boundary precipita- tion acted as a more effective barrier to dislocations.

In an Fe–Ni–Cr–Al (FNCA) alloy with a similar base composition to the alloy in the present study that did not include niobium, two variants of the Kurdjmov–Sachs relationship were found for NiAl [42]. If present in this alloy, this relationship might achieve a misfit with the matrix that would encourage ductility despite extensive grain boundary precipitation. If the more oft observed orientation relationships for NiAl and Laves phases are consistent for Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al (at%), this may explain why the coverage of the grain boundaries with these brittle precipitates might lead to sufficient ductility.4. SummaryThe microstructural and mechanical response to aging Fe– 20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al (at%) at 800 1C after a 1250 1C solution heat treatment was studied. With aging the Laves phase particles at first grew rapidly in the matrix and after 24 h showed steady growth to 301 nm after 1325 h. The NiAl matrix particles after 24 h were only 90 nm at the 24 h time interval and grew relatively quickly up to 734 nm after 1325 h. Both Laves and NiAl particles grew substantially on the grain boundaries and more than doubled in size as the sample was aged from 240 to 1325 h.Tensile tests were performed and the strain-hardening exponent generally showed a good fit to the Holloman equation. The unaged alloy showed two-stage work hardening. When the alloy was aged at 2.4 h an upper and lower yield point was observed. Improved strength was observed with increased grain boundary precipitation as the sample was aged, reaching a maximum of 383 MPa at 1325 h even though the interparticle spacing decreased.Even as the grain boundary precipitate coverage increased to 93% after 1325 h the alloy showed room temperature elongation of 19%. It was hypothesized that the ductility in the alloy may be related to the low-misfits of the precipitates with the austenite matrix.AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported by National Science Foundation Grant DMR 1206240.

            <Text>INTRODUCTION
Even with the surge in use of renewable energy, for the foreseeable future the primary energy source for power applications is likely to be fossil fuels, particularly with the low price of natural gas. Using these resources as efficiently as possible for both economic reasons and to minimize carbon dioxide emissions is critical (Viswanathan and Bakker, 2000; Viswanathan et al., 2005). In order for power plants to be more efficient they need to run at higher temperature: an operating temperature increase from 873 K to 1073 K would increase the efficiency from &lt;40% to &gt;50%, and reduce CO2 emissions by 40-50% (Smith and Shoemaker, 2004).  This requires materials that are strong enough, can withstand an environment that may contain impurities in addition to steam, display good oxidation and corrosion resistance and are economically viable (Viswanathan et al., 2005). The Department of Energy-defined goal for alloys for the next-generation Advanced Ultra Supercritical (AUSC) steam plants is 35 MPa at 1033 K, which are the conditions that we will focus on in this proposal.  Affordable materials that can satisfy these requirements will also likely find use in supercritical CO2 cycles and in tubing for concentrated thermal solar power. 
The martensitic/ferritic alloys that are currently used in power plants are limited to operating temperatures ≤873 K (Viswanathan and Bakker, 2000).  Nickel-based superalloys, some titanium alloys, and, possibly, oxide-dispersion strengthened ferritic alloys (Miller et al., 2003, 2005) can satisfy the strength and, at least for nickel-based alloys, the oxidation and corrosion requirements at elevated temperatures.  Unfortunately, these materials are too expensive except for use in specialized applications (Takeyama, 2007). This critical need for advanced materials for steam turbine components in ultra supercritical power plants has been long recognized and is the basis of efforts in Japan, Europe, China, India and the U.S. (Viswanathan and Bakker 2000; Takeyama, 2007, Di Gianfrancesco, 2017).  
Recent efforts in this area have focused on devising new austenitic steels strengthened with Laves phases (Maziasz, 1989; Takeyama et al., 2001; Takeyama, 2007; Yamamoto et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2008), whose purpose is to provide a “grain boundary (GB) precipitation strengthening mechanism” (Tarigan et al., 2011, 2012). The addition of aluminum can be used to improve oxidation resistance in these alloys (Yamamoto et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b; Brady et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b). Such alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels have shown promise to decrease our reliance on expensive nickel-base alloys for aggressive conditions in energy production and chemical processing environments (Brady et al., 2014).  AFAs use alumina instead of chromia as a protective oxide scale for high corrosion resistance since it is known to offer even better protection at high temperatures (Kofstas, 1995; Heubner 2000).  AFA stainless steels were in development as early as the 1970s (McGurty, 1978) and, more recently, a new family of AFAs has been under development at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL (Yamamoto et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b, 2008, 2011; Brady et al., 2005, 2007a, 2008; 2014).  In the newer grades of AFAs, B2-structured NiAl and Laves phase precipitates are present on both the GBs and in the austenitic matrix, while MC precipitates or L12-structured Ni3Al precipitates, which are present only in the matrix, are used to increase the creep strength (Brady et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2008; 2011).  While great strides have been made in the properties of these AFA stainless steels, optimization of their creep strength and oxidation resistance with a balance of cost for future commercialization (Brady et al., 2014) has been difficult because the deformation behavior is poorly understood. 
This proposal is focused on the deformation behavior of these materials with an emphasis on elucidating the “grain boundary (GB) precipitation strengthening mechanism” (Tarigan et al., 2011, 2012). It will involve meticulous microstructural and defect characterization of the model AFA stainless steel Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al before and after mechanical testing using both a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In-situ straining studies will be performed in both a TEM and a SEM in order to elucidate both dislocation/precipitate and dislocation/GB interactions, including determining the role of the precipitate free zone present along the GBs. While most work will be performed at Dartmouth, TEM in-situ straining will also be performed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) through collaboration with Dr. Eric Stach, Group Leader, Electron Microscopy.

FURTHER BACKGROUND
Laves-Phase Strengthened Austenitic Stainless Steels
Takeyama et al. (2001) systematically studied Laves phase precipitation in the austenitic Fe-20Cr-(25-40)Ni-2Nb (in at. %) quaternary alloy system.  The precipitates, which adopt the hexagonal C14 structure, are often referred to as the  phase.  For alloys containing 35 at. % Ni, the precipitates are elongated with many interfacial dislocations, whereas for alloys containing 25 at. % Ni the precipitates are smaller and more equi-axed.  In these Fe-Cr-Ni-Nb alloys, the c/a ratio of the precipitates decreases as the Ni content decreases for 15-25 at. % Ni and changes little with further increases in Ni content.  At 25 at. % Ni the c/a ratio is about the same as that of binary stoichiometric Fe2Nb at 1.63, which is near the value for the cubic symmetry C15 Laves structure.  Although the precipitates are referred to by Takeyama (2007) as Fe2Nb, they contain 14-15 at. % Cr, 26 at. % Nb and 17-25 at. % Ni, depending on the overall alloy composition.  Takeyama (2007) determined TTT curves for the precipitates and found that precipitation at 1173-1273 K occurred first on the grain GBs after ~300 s, but only after &gt;1000 s in the matrix.  After long ageing times (4.32 x 106 s, i.e. 1,200 h) the precipitates on the GBs became significantly larger (≤ 3 µm).  
In contrast, Yamamoto et al. (2007b) found that the  Laves phase precipitates in the matrix of the alloy Fe-15Cr-20Ni-(1-2)Nb were relatively stable during both ageing and creep testing at 1073 K.  This stability may arise partly from the semi-coherent interface of the Fe2Nb precipitates, as indicated by the strain contrast present in TEM images even after long-term annealing (Takeyama, 2007), and also from the presence of small additions of Al, Mo, C and B.  Small elemental additions have also been shown to stabilize Laves phases in other systems: Maziasz (1989) noted that Si additions led to the formation of Fe2(Mo,Nb) precipitates in austenitic alloys, while Yamamoto et al. (2008) found that small Zr additions promote Fe2Ti Laves phase precipitates.
Yamamoto et al. (2008) studied the microstructural evolution of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb alloys with and without additions of 0.4 Si, 0.2 Zr or 5.0 Al (in at. %) during creep at 1023 K and 100 MPa.  The Si addition helped to both refine the particle size (from ~1 µm to 300 nm) and produce a greater volume fraction of particles during ageing at 1073 K, and stabilized them against coarsening, resulting in superior creep resistance.  Interestingly, alloys that were only solution treated showed superior creep properties to those that were aged prior to creep testing.  The authors speculated that this phenomenon was because the particles that were dynamically precipitated during creep were finer (300-400 nm) and, thus, more effective at pinning dislocations.  The Zr addition improved the creep resistance more dramatically than the Si additions possibly by stabilizing very fine -Ni3Nb particles.  The addition of Al not only improved the creep resistance due to the formation of 30 nm diameter Ni3Al precipitates, but also improved the oxidation through the formation of a protective alumina layer on the surface.
The fundamental issues with the use of austenitic alloys for high temperature applications were clearly articulated by Yamamoto et al. (2008) who noted that “The strengthening effect of Fe2Nb (Laves phase) strongly depends on its size and volume fraction, indicating that the thermal stability of the particle size and distributions is the key to improve creep properties.”  More specifically, the two key issues are that: 1) the increase in size and density of the large Laves phase particles that develop on the GBs during creep testing (Yamamoto et al. 2008) will ultimately result in specimen failure when the GB coverage of these brittle particles is large enough; and 2) further refinement of the Laves phase precipitates to ~100 nm dia. is necessary to improve the creep strength (Yamamoto et al., 2008).  
Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) examined the effect of boron (0.03%) on the creep strength of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (in at. %).  Both the boron-doped and boron-free alloys contained Ni3Nb precipitates (the ” phase at short annealing times and the  phase at long times) within the grains and Laves phase precipitates on the GBs. The boron decreased the creep rate and increased the creep rupture life by a factor of almost four. The role of boron appeared to be to increase the extent of the Laves phase precipitation at the GBs.  Simply aging the boron-free alloy to increase the extent of GB coverage by the Laves phase from 52% to 89% also increased the creep rupture life, and decreased the creep rate to a similar extent as the boron addition.  That even with 89% GB coverage by the Laves phase precipitates a creep rupture strain of 77% was attained shows that the precipitates do not necessarily embrittle the alloy. Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) found that the creep rate,, was related to the area fraction covered by the GB Laves phase, , according to: 
/0 (1- 					- (1)
0 is the creep rate when  = 0. This idea is similar to earlier observations that in a Ni-20Cr-20W alloy the minimum creep rate decreased linearly with increasing density of an intergranular 2 phase (Matsuo et al., 1987), and that increasing GB carbide precipitation in Ni-20 Cr and Fe-15Cr-25 Ni alloys increased their creep resistance (Zhang et al., 1987, 1989a, 1989b, 1991).  Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) suggested that the role of the GB phase was to suppress deformation at the GBs, whereas Zhang et al.’s (1989a, 1991) TEM observations suggested that the GB precipitation was associated with higher dislocation densities that strengthened the GB region.
Recently, Chen et al. (2014) also studied Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb with and without 0.03% B and found that boron both increased the extent of and produced finer Laves phase precipitates on the GBs, but by &lt;10% after their longest anneal of 24 h, when the GB coverage in the B-doped alloy was ~80%.  Using an EPMA, they showed strong boron segregation to the GBs.  They found that for both the boron-doped and boron-free alloy, longer aging times prior to creep testing increased the creep life (by up to 100% for a 4 h versus a 12 h anneal), and that for the same aging time boron doping increased the creep life (by up to 44% for short aging times but by less at long aging times) by producing greater GB coverage of the Laves phase.  Chen et al.’s (2014) results were very similar to those of Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012).  Boron’s role appears to be to reduce the annealing time to obtain a large GB coverage by the Laves phase. 

Alumina-Forming Austenitic Stainless Steels
Even within particular grades of AFAs, the influence of specific precipitates on creep strength is complex.  A wide variety of creep strengths can be obtained with relatively small changes in alloying elements, and phases that are beneficial in some AFAs appear to cause decreased creep strength in others.  There are three grades of AFAs that have been investigated by the ORNL group based on their nickel content (in wt. %), viz., 12Ni, 20-25Ni and 32Ni. The 12Ni grade alloys substitute Mn for some of the Ni both to stabilize the austenite relative to the deleterious –Fe phase and to lower the cost.  Unfortunately, this grade has been shown to have relatively poor creep resistance although the reason for the decreased creep strength is poorly understood (Brady et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2011).  In 20-25 Ni grade alloys it has been found that the total weight fraction of carbide phases is important.  For example, in a 20-25Ni grade alloy with 2.53 wt. % Nb and 0.2 wt. % C there was little MC supersaturation and it showed poor creep resistance compared to 25Ni grade alloys with 1 wt.% Nb and 0.1 wt. % C.  It is believed that the 2.53 wt.% Nb alloy showed poorer creep strength because the 2.53 wt.% Nb addition decreased the supersaturation of MC carbides (Brady et al., 2014).  The 1 wt. % Nb and 0.1 wt. % C additions have been shown to be the optimal amounts for MC carbide strengthening in other studies of AFAs as well (Brady et al, 2008; Yamamoto et al., 2009).  While increasing the Nb content from 1 wt. % to 2.5 wt. % seemed to have a detrimental role on the creep strength for a 25Ni alloy, in the 32Ni grade alloys with 3.3 wt. % Nb superior creep strength has been observed at 923 K, a feature that appears to be due to strengthening from L12 Ni3Al precipitates, producing a creep strength almost five times greater than the best carbide-strengthened 20-25 Ni alloy.  While the L12 Ni3Al improved the creep properties of the 32Ni alloy, at 923 K it is believed that the metastable L12 Ni3Al caused the decreased rupture time observed in a 25Ni-4Al-1Nb alloy with increased C content compared to a 25Ni-3Al-1Nb alloy. Although the creep strength was promising there was a tradeoff with significantly reduced creep elongation in the 32Ni grade alloy, which is thought to be due to σ-phase formation.  At 1023 K, the 32Ni alloy creep results were comparable to those of both the 20-25Ni and 12Ni alloy grades (Brady et al., 2014). 
Similarly, Dong et al. (2013) studied the creep behavior of Fe-19.95Ni-14.19Cr-2.25Al-2.26Mo-1.95Mn-0.15Si-0.01B (wt.%) at 973 K and 150 MPa and found that an alloy with 0.86 % Nb and 0.07 % C had poor creep behavior due to the relatively coarse (100 nm) NbC, whereas a similar alloy with a lower carbon content (0.04 %) had much smaller carbides (10 nm) and much improved creep properties. An alloy with the same carbon content but lower Nb (0.5%) and the addition of 0.2% V had even better creep properties due to the formation of (Nb,V)C.  Both Laves phase and NiAl were found to be present after the creep testing, but Dong et al. (2013) questioned whether they contributed to the creep strength.
32Ni grade alloys with decreased chromium content (14 wt. % versus 19 wt. %) and additional alloying elements such as Zr and Ti have less σ-phase formation and improved creep properties.  Indeed, a Zr, Ti alloyed 32Ni alloy with additions of carbon and boron was shown to have a creep-rupture life that exceeded that of the commercially-available Fe-base alloy A286 by an order of magnitude (Yamamoto, Muralidharan and Brady, 2013).  Boron improves the creep properties of AFA stainless steels, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Unlike the Al-free Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb alloy studied by both Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) and Chen et al. (2014), the addition of boron to a 32Ni grade alloy did not seem to have a significant effect on GB precipitation, and in this case it was hypothesized that the boron addition formed a strain field in the matrix that increased resistance to creep deformation (Yamamoto, Muralidharan and Brady, 2013).  It is worth noting that unlike the Al-free alloys in which a solutionizing anneal can completely dissolve the Laves phase precipitates, in the more complex alloys developed at ORNL solutionizing anneals still leave substantial volume fractions of the Laves phase in the material (Yamamoto, Muralidharan, Brady, 2013; Brady et al., 2014, Hu et al., 2014).
	While computational methods have helped in the design AFA alloys to limit the formation of deleterious phases, such as the sigma phase, and to help stabilize the austenitic matrix, it is clear that the additions of small alloying elements and their effect on the properties of AFA stainless steels require more detailed microstructural characterization. Even with an understanding of what phases may be present, creep mechanisms in this system are not well enough understood to predict which potential strengthening precipitate will be most beneficial for creep strength.  For many of the AFA alloys that were also tensile tested, the creep and elevated temperature tensile properties did not correlate well.  For example, in the 20-25 Ni grade alloys while B2-NiAl and Laves precipitation improves tensile properties, MC carbides appear to show a stronger influence on the creep strength (Brady et al, 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2011).  The ORNL group also questioned whether the Laves phase even had any significant influence on the creep strength (Bei et al., 2010). The lower tensile strength they observed in these alloys at 1023 K compared to room temperature appeared to be due to the softening of the B2 NiAl phase which produces significant strengthening at room temperature. This lack of correlation between the elevated temperature yield strength and the creep life is well illustrated in the data presented by Dong et al. (2013), see Table 1, although the strain hardening exponent, n, did show roughly the same trend as the creep life.

There has been little examination of the microstructure of specimens to failure.  However, a recent study of the ORNL alloy DAFA 29 (Fe-14Cr-0.1Mn-32Ni-0.1Cu-3Al-0.2Si-2.9Nb-2Ti-0.1Mo-0.3Zr-0.1C-0.1B) showed that creep failure after 5282 h under a stress of 100 MPa at 1023 K showed cracking around the GBs with some cracks passing through precipitates and others circumventing precipitates.  It is worth noting that it is unclear whether the crack path is exactly along the GB or whether it is really through the large precipitate free zone (PFZ) that is next to the GB.  Also, the imposed stress was three times the “design” stress for these alloys.

The Intellectual Merit of this Activity was to understand both the effects of deformation on the precipitation processes in Laves phase-strengthened austenitic steels, including determining the mechanism of NiAl co-precipitation, and how these two kinds of precipitates affect subsequent room-temperature deformation processes. In addition, some preliminary creep testing was performed on two home-built constant-stress creep rigs, based on a design by Garofalo, Richmond and Domis (1962).

The Broader Impacts of the Activity include the education of a female African-American Ph.D. student, Geneva Trotter (now employed at Applied Predictive Technologies), a female American M.S. student, Natalie Afonina, and eight undergraduates: Hughes Lee, Ryan Strain, Evan Schlick, Hailey Nicholson, Amaris De La Rosa-Morena (a minority student), Bingyue Wang, Yi (Annie) Sun and Reed Harder, with 

the four women undergraduates supported by Dartmouth’s Women in Science Program. The later two were co-authors on a journal paper. 


	Two observations in the work have broad applicability to alloy design in other systems: (1) cold work can lead to more rapid precipitation of a higher volume fraction of finer precipitates; and (2) even with almost complete coverage of the GBs by a brittle phase, extensive room temperature tensile ductility can still be achieved (see below). The work has been disseminated by the publication of six journal papers (Trotter et al., 2014a; Trotter and Baker, 2015a,b; Hu et al., 2013, 2015; Trotter et al, 2016), a paper recently submitted to a journal (Hu et al., 2016a), and through eleven conference presentations (Trotter, Rayner and Baker, 2012, 2013a, 2013b; Trotter et al. 2014b, 2014c; Hu, et al., 2014; Trotter and Baker, 2015c, 2015d, 2016; Baker et al., 2016; 2017).  The work involved collaborations with Drs. M.K. Miller and L. Yao (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), Drs. S. Chen and Z. Cai (Argonne National Laboratory) and Prof. P.R. Munroe (U. New South Wales, Australia).
Our work studied the effects of cold work on the simplified AFA stainless steel Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al - many of the alloys studied by the ORNL Group and others are much more complex containing 10 or so elements (Brady et al., 2014).  Cold rolling was performed, after solution treatment at 1523 K, to 25%, 50% and 90% rolling reductions with subsequent ageing performed for various times at 973 K, 1073 K and 1173 K. A significant density of dislocations was found in the matrix in the solutionized and aged specimens even without cold rolling, possibly due to the punching out of dislocations around the precipitates during cooling, see Figure 2. 
We found that cold work accelerated the precipitation kinetics of both the C14-type Fe2Nb-type Laves phase and the B2-type NiAl precipitates markedly compared to simply aging, presumably due to heterogeneous precipitation on dislocations, see Figure 3.  It is worth noting that in the material that was simply aged, the Laves phase precipitates nucleate before the B2 precipitates, but it is no longer clear that this sequence occurs after cold work and aging, see Figure 3.




While often co-located, the Laves phase and B2 particles are distinct. L12 (ordered f.c.c.) precipitates were also present in samples aged at 973 K with 90% prior cold work, but not in specimens annealed at 1073 K, which is in line with thermodynamic calculations, see Figure 4. The additional fine L12 precipitates present at 973 K are presumably the reason for the greater hardness of the 973 K annealed material (Trotter et al., 2014a). We have shown, using atom probe tomography, that the L12 precipitates in the ORNL-developed AFA steel DAFA 26 are Ni3(Al,Ti). Compared to material that had not been strained, defects introduced by cold work not only caused more rapid precipitation in the matrix but also increased the total volume fraction of precipitates as compared to material that had been simply aged, see Figure 3.  Histograms of the particle size distributions were produced for each annealing time and temperature (not shown here), and, as might be expected, they were lognormal with the particle size increasing steadily with increasing time and increasing temperature (Trotter et al., 2014a).


The orientation relationship between the Laves phase precipitates and the austenite matrix was found to be (0001)Fe2Nb || (111)γ :[1010]Fe2Nb || [110]γ (Denham and Silcock, 1969), while the B2 precipitates show the #m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p Kurjamov-Sachs relationship (Trotter and Baker, 2015a).  





We also examined the effects of simply aging on the microstructure and room temperature tensile properties of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al and the results are dramatic, see Figure 5. Table 2 lists the average particle diameter for matrix and GB Laves and NiAl precipitates and the % GB coverage.
￼


After solutionizing for 24 h at 1523 K the Laves phase precipitates had dissolved, see Figure 6. This material had a yield strength of 205 MPa, an elongation to failure of 52% and a low, uniform work hardening rate of ~300 MPa. A 2.4 h anneal at 1073 K, which produced substantial GB coverage of fine alternating Laves phase and NiAl precipitates but only a few small precipitates within the grains, gave a 57% increase in yield strength to 322 MPa with an increase in work-hardening rate, and a slight reduction in elongation to 37%. For this heat-treatment only there is a clear yield drop and a long Lüders region, see Figure 5.  Longer anneals increase the size and volume fraction of the precipitates both in the grain and on the GBs, and lead to almost complete coverage of the GBs after a 1325 h anneal, see Figure 6.

These changes increase the yield strength, work-hardening rate, and decrease the elongation, see Figure 5. The substantial increase in both yield strength and work-hardening rate for the longer anneals is consistent with Orowan looping around the precipitates within the grains, which produces substantial increases in dislocation density, including dislocation loops and dislocation dipoles.  Remarkably, even though the GBs are completely covered in brittle NiAl and Laves phase precipitates after the 1325h anneal, the material can still show 19% elongation!

We also performed tensile tests and preliminary creep studies at 1033 K on Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al given four of the heat treatments (0, 2.4, 24 and 240 h at 1073 K) used for the room temperature tensile tests shown in Figure 5. In the 1033 K tensile tests the alloy exhbited significantly lower elongations than at room temperature for all ageing times, see Table 3, with no work-hardening observed. As might be expected, the yield strengths were lower at 1033 K compared to room temperature, but surprisingly the material annealed for 240 h, which was one of the strongest when tested at room temperature, was even weaker than the solutionized material. In fact, the latter material was only slightly weaker at 1033 K than at room temperature, possibly due to some very fine precipitation during the test.
Creep tests at 1033 K showed that the 2.4 h and 24 h annealed specimens had similar secondary creep rates, although the 24 h annealed specimen had a slightly larger creep strain due to the greater initial primary creep, see Figure 7. This result is, perhaps, a little surprising since the particle sizes were significantly larger and the GB coverage significantly greater for the 24 h-annealed specimen, and no NiAl was detected on the GBs for the 2.4 anneal.  By comparison, the creep rate was significantly higher for the specimen annealed for 240 h, where particle sizes were larger still, but GB coverage was greater. Surprisingly, material tested in the solutionized condition (0 h anneal) shows a creep rate faster that of the 2.4 h and 24 h annealed material, but much slower than the 240 h annealed material. As shown in Figure 8, precipitation occurred in the solutionized Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al during creep testing, but this did not appear to affect the creep rate as testing continued.  In fact, since the aging temperatures were only 40 K above the creep test temperatures, the precipitate structure examined in all the crept specimens had clearly evolved compared to the uncrept specimens, see Figure 8. We also examined the heads of the crept specimens, which had seen the same temperature but not the stress seen by the guage of the specimens and the prceipitate structure in these had evolved in a similar way to the guage.

There are several interesting observations that can be made based on these preliminary creep studies. First, our results do not corroborate the observation made by others (Yamamoto et al. 2011; Dong et al., 2013; Brady et al., 2014) that the creep rate does not correlate well with the yield strength even if measured at the creep test temperature.  The creep rates in Figure 7 are clearly correlated with the yield strengths made at the same temperature (Table 3). Second, Yamamoto et al. (2008) found that solution-treated Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb showed superior creep properties to those for material aged prior to creep testing, possibly because the particles that were dynamically precipitated during creep of the solution-treated material were finer. While the latter precipitation phenomenon certainly occurs in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al, this did not lead to a lower creep rate than in material given the shorter (2.4 h, 24 h) ageing anneals. Third, the results do not validate the empirical equation determined by Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) and Chen et al. (2014) that the strain rate decreases with increasing coverage of the GBs by precipitates as shown inequation (1) since the 240-h heat treated material, which has the greatest GB precipitate coverage, shows a significantly higher creep rate than the 2.4 h and 24 h annealed material. A key difference from the work of Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) and Chen et al. (2014) is that in their work the GB precipitates were only Laves phase (since their alloys did not contain Al), whereas the alloy tested here has alternating Laves phase and B2 precipitates, and the latter will likely be softer than the matrix at the test temperature. Fourth, the results also do not agree with the suggestion by Dong et al. (2013) and Bei et al. (2010) that the Laves phase and NiAl do not contribute to the creep strength since the 2.4 h- and 24 h-annealed Laves phase and NiAl particle-containing material have lower creep rates than the particle-free material.
Scientific Questions
The Results from Prior Research along with the reviewed literature suggest three intriguing questions:
1.	How do gliding or climbing dislocations interact with the precipitates in austenitic AFA stainless steels both in the matrix and the GBs? In particular, how do the Laves, NiAl and Ni3Al precipitates’ size and spacing affect the creep strength of AFA stainless steels, and is the creep strength ultimately compromised by the PFZ?  
2.	How does the evolution of the precipitates under an applied stress at high temperature affect the deformation mechanisms?
3.	How can an alloy in which brittle Laves and B2 phases almost completely cover the GBs still show good room-temperature tensile elongation (~19%)? Intimately connected to this is the role of the PFZ.  









This proposal focuses on answering these questions.  The answers will not only provide the relevant understanding to develop improved AFA stainless steels, but will also be useful for other advanced alloys that are being developed which incorporate brittle intermetallics and GB strengthening phases that were often avoided in alloy design in the past. In other words, having obtained answers to these questions, can we utilize thermo-mechanical treatments to optimize precipitate distribution and the size of the PFZ in AFA steels to improve their mechanical properties?

Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity
The aim and intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to ascertain the deformation mechanisms associated with GB precipitation strengthening, and to understand the fundamental deformation behavior in materials containing both a PFZ and multiple types of precipitates in both the GBs and the lattice each of which can contribute differently to the deformation behavior. The work will be performed on the model AFA stainless steel Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al with which we have considerable experience.

PROPOSED RESEARCH
The research proposed here will attempt to elucidate the strengthening mechanisms in AFA stainless steels, and, in particular, we will attempt to answer the questions posed above.  
Thus, we will:
1. Examine the dislocation structures in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al given different thermo-mechanical treatments and crept for different times.
2. Perform TEM in-situ straining experiments at room temperature and at 1033 K on both uncrept Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al and material crept for different times.
3. Perform SEM in-situ straining experiments at room temperature and at 1033 K on both uncrept Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al and material crept for different times.

	Figure 9 is a schematic outlining the overall approach to the proposed work. We will use the same material as that previously used for the creep and high temperature tensile tests, i.e. a press-forged 8 kg ingot of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al supplied by Mr. Michael Schmidt, CarTech Corporation. The microstructure of the model alloy being studied is shown schematically in Figure 10.  

Figure 9. Schematic outlining the approach to the proposed work















There are three features to this structure:
1.	Matrix precipitates: After elevated temperature annealing, the f.c.c. matrix contains fine coherent L12 Ni3Al precipitates, and larger B2 NiAl and Fe2Nb Laves phase precipitates. The Laves phase precipitates in the matrix nucleate before the B2 precipitates and, thus, for short annealing times it is possible to have only L12 and Fe2Nb Laves phase precipitates in the matrix.  All the precipitates coarsen upon annealing and the L12 precipitates may lose their coherency upon prolonged annealing.
2.	Grain Boundary precipitates: Upon annealing the GBs become covered in B2 and Laves precipitates, whose size and extent increases with annealing time until almost complete GBs coverage occurs.
3.	PFZ: At longer annealing times (240 h) a clear PFZ forms adjacent to the GBs. This region is potentially much weaker than the matrix and the GBs, and, thus, is a potential fracture path.  On the other hand, the easier flow in the PFZ may allow it to accommodate strains from the GB.

Creep Tests
As noted above, we have already performed preliminary creep tests at 1033 K to 600 h for as-solutionized (0 h) Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al and material annealed for 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h at 1073 K.  We will also perform constant-stress creep tests for shorter (100 h, 300 h) and longer times (1500 h, 3000 h or to failure) at 1033 K at a stress of 35 MPa. We have already loaded two specimens for the long-term creep tests, which will be ready for analysis should this proposal be funded.
To produce different amounts of GB coverage by the Laves phase and NiAl precipitates and different PFZ widths for similar precipitate distributions in the matrix, we will use two approaches.  First, we will cold roll material before ageing at 1073 K. This accelerates precipitation in the matrix but not in the grain boundaries (Trotter et al., 2014a), see Figure 3. Second, we will age material at lower temperatures.  This will lead to precipitation on the GBs, but less so in the matrix.  These additional specimens will allow us to separate effects associated with GB precipitation from effects due to matrix precipitation.
In monitoring the creep data, we will examine both the creep strain versus time (see, for example, Figure 7) and the creep strain rate versus creep strain. Analysis of the microstructures of specimens crept for different times (see below) will enable us to understand how the microstructure evolves over time and how this affects the creep behavior. These specimens will be used to make standard TEM and SEM specimens and TEM in-situ straining specimens,  

Microstructural Analysis
Microstructural characterization of the alloys will be performed both before and after testing. It is worth noting that the head of the creep specimens provides material that has seen the same temperature and time, but has not seen the stress of the creep specimen gauge, and so this provides a specimen that has simply been annealed. Thus, we will compare specimens take from the head with specimens taken from the gauge in order to understand what effect the applied stress has on precipitation (see Figure 8).  
	Backscattered electron imaging using a FEI XL30 field emission gun (FEG) SEM will be used to obtain the precipitate size distribution (frequency versus size) and spacing both within the grain and in the GB, as performed in Trotter et al. (2014a), see Figures 3 and 6. Diffraction-contrast transmission electron microscopy will be performed using a FEI Tecnai FEG 200 keV TEM to examine the precipitates in detail. A previous report on crept Laves-Phase-strengthened austenitic steels have suggested that the Laves phase precipitates become smaller during creep (Yamamoto et al., 2008). Both energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) will also be performed to clearly identify the precipitates.  Higher Order Lower Zone (HOLZ) line shifts in the transmitted disc in CBED patterns will be used to assess strains in the phases (Williams and Carter, 1996).

Deformation Mechanisms
Three approaches will be used to examine the deformation mechanisms.
Post-mortem TEM dislocation analysis will be performed on specimens crept at 1033 K and from room temperature tensile testing. Of particular interest is how changes in precipitate size and spacing affect the precipitate’s interactions with dislocations and whether greater GB precipitation is associated with increased dislocation densities in the GB region, as reported by Zhang et al. (1989a, 1991).

Two in-situ straining approaches (in-situ TEM, in-situ SEM) will be performed at both room temperature and 1033 K in order to examine the deformation mechanisms for a variety of precipitate sizes and spacings (see above). We will also perform some TEM in-situ straining experiments on crept specimens.

TEM in-situ Straining: TEM in-situ straining experiments will be performed at both room temperature and 1033 K on Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al with different particle sizes and spacings (see above) in order to observe the fundamental dislocation/precipitate interactions directly. It is worth noting that the P.I. has nearly 30 year’s experience with TEM in-situ straining experiments (Baker, Horton and Schulson, 1987; Baker, Schulson and Horton, 1987; Baker, Guha and Horton, 1993; Baker, and Horton, 1993; Baker et al., 1991; Baker and Liu, 1994; Horton, Baker and Yoo, 1991; Nagpal and Baker, 1991; Nagpal, Baker and Horton, 1994; Loudis and Baker, 2008; Liao and Baker, 2008, 2011a, 2011b), including recent work by Liao and Baker (2011a, 2011b) where TEM in situ straining observations at various temperatures up to 900 K were used to quantitatively explain the yield stress anomaly observed in Fe2MnAl.
Numerous features can be observed during TEM in-situ straining experiments including dislocation cross-slip, dislocation climb, dislocation pinning, and dislocation pile-ups. The curvature of dislocations can be used to estimate local stresses, e.g. Liao and Baker (2011a, 2011b), and the shift of HOLZ lines in the transmitted disc in CBED patterns will be used to assess local strains (Williams and Carter, 1996). TEM in-situ straining is not that useful for studying fracture per se since the fracture path in a thin foil may be different to that in the bulk (Baker, Horton and Schulson, 1987; Baker, Schulson and Horton, 1987).

SEM in-situ Straining: SEM in-situ straining experiments will be performed at both room temperature and 1033 K on Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al with different particle sizes and spacings in attempts to examine the fracture path, i.e. does it occur through GB precipitates, between the precipitates and the PFZ, or through the PFZ: the path may change depending on the heat treatment. The experiments will be performed on notched specimens so that we know in advance approximately where fracture will occur. The specimens will be recorded continuously during in-situ straining, but they will also be examined post-straining at high resolution. In addition to BSE imaging of the precipitates, electron channeling contrast imaging will be used to provide a view of the dislocation behavior after straining (Welsch et al., 2016). 

Mechanisms
It is worth considering what may happen during in-situ straining of an AFA steel. In general, at room temperature dislocations will cut through small coherent deformable particles, and loop around larger nondeformable particles (Orowan looping). The former produces a low work-hardening rate since once the particle is cut by a dislocation, passage of subsequent dislocations is easier.  Since the dislocation cuts the particle, the strength of the alloy is strongly dependent on the properties and dislocation behavior of the particle. For Orowan looping, the strength is strongly dependent on size and spacing but not on the mechanical properties of the particles. Examination of the stress-strain curves in Figure 5 suggests that particle cutting may be occurring in the material annealed for 2.4 h since this exhibits a low work-hardening rate (although considerably higher than that of the unannealed, particle-free material).  For longer annealing times, the substantially higher work-hardening rate suggest that Orowan looping is occurring, although one might expect the work-hardening rate to decrease with increasing annealing times as the particles increase in size and the interparticle spacing decreases.  


While this simple picture of particle cutting versus Orowan looping is appropriate for a material with a single type of precipitate, it may not be appropriate for the AFA steel studied here, which has three different precipitates. The Laves phase is not likely to deform at room temperature, and in the ORNL alloy DAFA 29 very large Laves precipitates, which are formed during the casting process, crack during room temperature deformation, see Figure 11. 


On the other hand, when the L12 precipitates are small, a/2 [101] dislocations gliding on a {111} slip plane will pile-up at the particle interface, and eventually glide through the precipitate in pairs of a/2 [101] dislocations-coupled by an anti-phase boundary (APB) on {111}, see Figure 12(a). This behavior occurs in some nickel-based superalloys and aluminum alloys containing L12 precipitates.  It might also be possible for dislocation cutting to occur in the B2 particles. As noted earlier, the ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship was observed between the B2 particles and the f.c.c. matrix (Trotter and Baker, 2015a).  Slip typically occurs by a&lt;010&gt; or APB-coupled a/2&lt;111&gt; dislocations at room temperature in B2 compounds (Baker, 1995), with NiAl-based B2 compounds normally deforming by the glide of a&lt;100&gt; dislocations.  The a/2&lt;111&gt; dislocations gliding in the f.c.c. matrix might lead to a&lt;010&gt; or APB-coupled a/2&lt;111&gt; dislocations gliding in the B2 particles since the slip planes are aligned, see Figure 12(b,c).  As the L12 and B2 precipitates increase in size upon annealing, the deformation behavior will eventually change from dislocation cutting to Orowan looping.  However, the particle size at which this transition occurs will be different for different types of particles since it depends on the surface energies on the slip planes, the Burger’s vector and the shear modulus. For larger undeformable particles (≥ 0.1 µm), substantial local lattice rotations (up to ~45o) occur around the particles at larger deformations (Humphreys 1979), the local lattice rotations increasing with increasing particle size for a given strain.
A priori, it is not clear whether dislocation looping or particle cutting occurs in the three different precipitates, at what particle size particle the transition from cutting to looping occurs, whether one type of particle controls the strength or all contribute to the strength. We should also note the observation in Figure 2 that dislocations are punched out at the Laves phase particles due to the differences in thermal expansion between the particles and the matrix.  This may mean that gliding matrix dislocations do not encounter the particles per se, but interact with the dislocations around the Laves phase particles.
Turning to high temperature deformation, at elevated temperature cutting and looping can still occur, but, dislocations can also climb around precipitates (Honeycombe, 1984) and cross-slip around the precipitates becomes more likely (Smallman, 1985). It is worth noting that if dislocation cutting of the precipitates occurs, this can lead to mechanical dissolution of the precipitates and at elevated temperatures their re-precipitation. In other words, there are a greater number of possibilities of how deformation takes place at higher temperatures.















Regarding how this applies to the AFA steel, we do not know whether the L12 particles will get softer or harder with increasing temperatures as some L12 compounds such as Ni3Al can show a yield anomaly (Pope and Ezz, 1984; Liu and Pope, 1995). In contrast, the B2 precipitates would be expected to lose their strength at ~0.45 Tm, where Tm is the melting point, as is observed in B2 alloys (Baker 1995). Laves phases are brittle but they can show plastic flow under compression even at room temperature via a twinning mechanism involving synchroshear though the movement of 1/6&lt;211&gt; synchroshockley partials on the basal plane (Chu and Pope, 1993a,b; Hazzledine and Pirouz, 1993; Kumar et al, 2000; Kumar and Hazzledine, 2004; Chisholm, Kumar and Hazzledine, 2005; Takata et al., 2009, 2013a, b, 2016; Heggen, Houben and Feuerbacher, 2010; Yang et al., 2012).  Interestingly, Takata et al. (2013a) found both basal and non-basal slip occurred at a lower stress in Laves phase nanopillars, which had previously been nanoindented than in non-nanoindented nanopillars, suggesting that the difficulty of dislocation nucleation contributes to their normally brittle behavior. Chu and Pope (1993a,b) found plastic flow occurred at 1073 K, in a C15 Laves phase by ½&lt;110&gt; slip. Recent TEM observations of the ORNL alloy DAFA29 indicate that dislocation glide occurs within the Laves phase precipitates during straining at 973 K, see Figure 12. 
The creep curves in Figure 7 clearly indicate that the particles improve the creep rate, and that this improvement becomes less as the particles get bigger.  A key question is do all the particles contribute to the improved creep rate or only some of them, and do the deformation mechanisms change as the particles get bigger.  Also, can the B2 particles, which will be softer than the matrix, strengthen the material by trapping gliding matrix dislocations.




Thus far, we have only discussed the behavior of particles in the matrix, however, the Laves phase and B2 phase particles were originally added to AFA steels as GB strengtheners.  Thus, we will also examine the interaction of gliding dislocations with the B2 and Laves phase precipitates at the GBs. At room temperature, these phases are expected to be harder than the matrix and would be strong barriers to dislocation transmission. Of interest is whether dislocations impinging on the GB behave differently when they encounter a B2 precipitate rather than a Laves phase precipitate – as noted earlier, Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) suggested that the role of the GB Laves phase was to suppress deformation at the GBs, whereas Zhang et al.’s (1989a, 1991) TEM observations suggested that the GB precipitation was associated with higher dislocation densities that strengthened the GB region. Research on f.c.c./B2 lamellar structured FeNiMnAl alloys showed that initial yielding occurred in the softer f.c.c. phase, but that the B2 phase yielded once work hardening in the f.c.c. phase had increased its flow stress to the yield stress of the B2 phase (Liao and Baker, 2011). Also, for the shorter annealing time of 2.4 h only about half of the GB is covered in dislocations.  How does this affect the deformation at the GBs? 
During high temperature deformation, the GBs could be viewed quite differently.  Now, there is a hard Laves phase precipitate and a soft B2 precipitate.  Is this advantageous, or does deformation within the B2 particles caused strains at the GBs that cause the fracture.  This would be consistent with the lower fracture strains observed in tensile tests at 1033 K compared to room temperature, see Table 3.  An alternative is than strains generated at the GBs lead to punching out of dislocations in the nearby matrix. 
A further complication both for understanding both room temperature and elevated temperature deformation is the presence of a PFZ, which is quite pronounced in the AFA steel at longer annealing times. Nembach and co-workers (Baither et al., 2003; Krol et al., 2003) used in-situ TEM straining to study the interaction of gliding dislocations with the PFZ in the polycrystalline gamma-prime strengthened nickel-based superalloy Nimonic PE16. They found that the PFZ reduces the yield strength only if the width of the PFZ’s exceeds 1.7( - r), where is interparticle spacing and r is radius of the L12 particles. For widths greater than this, dislocations are generated in the PFZ itself and the resulting dislocation pile-ups lead to a yield strength reduction.  Thus, a question regarding the PFZ is whether this acts differently than the matrix, allowing significantly more strain there since it is softer than the matrix.
The TEM in-situ straining studies will be performed on Dartmouth’s Tecnai FEG TEM for which the P.I. has a Gatan single-tilt, hot-straining stage (operates to 1273 K) and a video system. It is important to correlate the in-situ straining experiments with the post-mortem TEM analysis. The latter can provide Burgers vector information, but always has the possibility that the dislocations have rearranged themselves (particularly after high temperature deformation) so that one does not see the real line direction of the gliding dislocations. These studies will benefit from the utilization of a first-of-its-kind direct electron detector at BNL, which allows capture of in-situ videos at unprecedented time resolution, with full resolution data obtainable at up to 1600 frames/sec. BNL personnel also have considerable experience with TEM in-situ straining experiments. It is worth noting that while the macroscopic loading rates in both of these set-ups can be varied, control is not precise enough to determine strain rate sensitivities.

Analysis of the Results
Rösler and Artz (1990) developed a model to predict the creep rate for a particle-containing material. However, this is for a single type of hard undeformable, typically oxide, particle in which the rate controlling mechanism is breaking away from the particle after the dislocation has largely bypassed it (Schröder, and Arzt, 1985; Czyrska-Filemonowicz et al., 1995; Häussler et al., 2001). The model does not consider GB particles. Zhang et al.’s (1991) creep model attempts to separate the strengthening from precipitates in the grain from those in the GB but again includes only one type of undeformable particle.  Neither model incorporates the possibility than softer particles may strengthen the material.  While the primary goal of the proposed work is not model development, we will attempt to develop a model based on our experimental observations. What form this will take is difficult to say. It is worth noting that the P.I. has experience in developing deformation models e.g. on the role of both GBs and particles on the ductility of intermetallic compounds (Baker and Schulson, 1989; Baker, 1999); a well-accepted model for the yield anomaly in FeAl (George and Baker, 1998); and a model for strain-induced ferromagnetism in intermetallic compounds (Yang, Baker and Martin, 1999; Wu, Munroe and Baker, 2003).  

Personnel/Budget/Timeline
The project will run for three years with a starting date of September 1st, 2017. The P.I., a Ph.D. student and a number of undergraduates, typically two per year, will perform the work. Funds are requested for graduate student support, partial support of the P.I., travel, TEM/SEM time and supplies. 

BROADER IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED ACTIVITY
The results from this work will help to elucidate the deformation behavior of AFA stainless steels by understanding the interactions between dislocations and the precipitates. This will help not only in the future design of AFA steels but in understanding deformation in commercial alloys such as Crofer 22H (Barrilao, Kuhn and Wessel, 2016) and in several alloys being developed (Kuhn et al., 2016; Yamamoto et al, 2016; Takeyama, 2007; Tarigan et al., 2011, 2012) in which Laves phase precipitates are present in both the matrix and cover the grain boundaries and a PFZ is present. It will elucidate whether brittle GB precipitates are useful to incorporate in alloys for creep strengthening, and if the inclusion of precipitates that are softer than the matrix can improve creep behavior. It will attempt to understand why substantial tensile ductility is possible even when the GBs are covered with brittle phases, which will aid in their incorporation in other alloys systems. Finally, it will aid in designing and understanding the deformation behavior of novel alloys that contain multiple types of precipitates with different properties. The deliberate incorporation of brittle intermetallic compounds represents a paradigm shift in alloy design.
The project will also lead to the training of a number of undergraduates and a Ph.D. student.
Promoting graduate training: At the end of the project, in addition to the knowledge from formal coursework, the Ph.D. student will have gained skills in mechanical testing and materials characterization. For professional development, the student will take the Teaching Science seminar offered by Dartmouth's Center for the Advancement of Learning. All graduate students are required to undertake Dartmouth’s Ethics training program. The P.I. will support and encourage the student to attend professional development workshops such as the Teaching Science seminar and the Communicating Research workshop series offered through Dartmouth's Center for the Advancement of Learning (DCAL), which was attended by the student on the current project. Dartmouth’s Outreach Office works with DCAL to integrate these trainings with opportunities for hands-on application through science outreach in local schools, such as lunch-time Science Cafes where graduate students have informal conversations with middle school youngsters about their fields, and Science Pubs, in which community members and researchers have lively conversations about science topics. DCAL does formative assessments of its graduate student professional development programs for continuous quality improvement; outcomes of our Ph.D. program are assessed through both a Thayer School survey and an on-line survey for comparison with other institutions.  Ph.D. students have an exit interview with the Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs.
Innovation: Thayer School of Engineering offers a Ph.D. Innovation Program designed to teach students the skills needed to be effective in the innovation process.  Innovation Ph.D. fellowship funding is available after a student’s 3rd year. We expect that the graduate on this project will join this program.
Integrating research and teaching: The P.I. expects to have two undergraduates assist on the project each year funded by NSF REU funds, Dartmouth’s nationally honored Women in Science Project (WISP) and possibly a student (male or female) funded by the Thayer School’s First Year Research in Engineering (FYRE) program that started in 2015. They will gain laboratory and research experience and will be required to take both laboratory safety and ethics training before starting their research. Typically, the PI has 5-6 undergraduates per year who work with graduate students on funded projects. They are typically supported by WISP, FYRE or by NSF REU funds. The Ph.D. student will share responsibility for mentoring the undergraduates, whose research on this project will integrate closely with their own. The undergraduates will take both laboratory safety and ethics training before beginning research. Minorities and, particularly, women have been well represented in amongst undergraduate participants.
Broadening participation: Dartmouth courts minority students at all degree levels, and we will encourage women and members of minority groups to apply for the graduate student position on this project. The Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College will pay for the travel to Dartmouth of any suitable applicants. Currently 38% of Ph.D. students at Thayer School are female and 50% of the P.I.’s graduate students are women; at the undergraduate level 52% of 2016 graduated engineering majors at Dartmouth were female! The P.I. has a track record of successfully mentoring women students through participation in institutional programs such as Dartmouth’s WISP program and will build on this experience (the PI has a fifteen-year WISP participation award). WISP, which has been successful in improving retention rates of women in science and engineering at Dartmouth, emphasizes student research experience. In addition to encouraging broader participation of women in science and engineering, this type of hands-on, interactive, contextual and collaborative learning has been shown to encourage participation of other underrepresented groups (Green et al. 2000; Goodman 2002; Lopatto, 2007; Hunter, Laursen and Seymour, 2007). 
Broad dissemination: In addition to publishing the results of the research in refereed journals and presenting them at conferences, we will work with the Science Writer in Dartmouth’s Office of Public Affairs to disseminate new findings on Dartmouth’s web site and to the news media as appropriate. In addition, material developed in this work will be used in a graduate course on Materials Characterization.

AFAs use alumina as a protective oxide scale for high corrosion resistance since alumina is known to offer even better protection than chromia at high temperatures [2,3]. AFA stainless steels were in devel- opment as early as the 1970s [4] and more recently AFAs have received renewed atten- tion for their promising materials properties [1,5–21].Within particular grades of AFAs, the influence of precipitate phases on creep strength is complex. A wide variety of creep strengths can be obtained with relatively small changes in alloying elements. Phases that are beneficial in some AFAs cause decreased creep strength in others. The Laves phase, for example, having shown long- term stability at high temperatures [7,9,15,22], has been investigated for its ability to act as a strengthener [7,9,18,20,21]. Along with the Laves phase, the role of B2-NiAl particles in AFAs has been investigated. B2-NiAl particles have been shown to act as strengtheners in room temperature tensile tests in AFA alloys, but have not shown any strengthening effect at 750 °C due to the brittle-to-ductile transition common to B2 intermetallic compounds [15]. The B2 particles support the formation of the alumina layer in AFAs by acting as an Al reservoir [13,15].*Corresponding author.

2 G. Trotter and I. BakerThe Laves phase has an AB2 stoichiometry and can exist as three closely related structures C14, C15 and C36. C15 (MgCu2, Fd"3m) is the cubic form of the Laves phase, C14 is a hexagonal structure (MgZn2, P63/mmc) and C36 which is also hexagonal (MgNi2, P63/mmc). Identification of the specific structure prevalent for an alloy system can vary with composition and heat treatment [23]. In some instances dif- ferent structures are present in a given alloy [24] or one structure transforms into another [25–27]. Two crystal structures can often be present in a single particle [25,28]. The C14-type Fe2Nb Laves phase that has been observed in studies of AFAs and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images typically has a plate-like morphology.The B2-NiAl phase has CsCl crystal structure, space group Pm"3m. B2 particles are spherical in some materials such as precipitation-hardenable martensitic stainless steels [29] and have also shown plate-like morphology in Fe–Ni–Cr–Al (FNCA) alloys [30,31]. There are few observations of diffraction patterns with the Laves phase being compared along with its parent matrix. While extensive work has been done recently by Bhowmik and coworkers [32–37] and Kumar and coworkers in the past [24,25,38–40] in under- standing Cr2Ta Laves phase structures and polymorphs, observed in Cr–Ta alloys, the Fe2Nb Laves phase has received comparatively very little attention. As noted in [23] there are not many clear diffraction patterns in the literature depicting the Laves phase in stain- less steel. In this study, both Laves phase and B2-NiAl particles were formed from ageing a solutionized, single-phase f.c.c. matrix of Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al, with the objective of determining the crystallographic relation between the f.c.c. matrix and the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates via transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations.ExperimentalFe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al (at. %) was cast into 15.24-cm long, 2.54-cm diameter ingots by vacuum arc-melting followed by drop casting into a copper crucible, courtesy of Dr Easo P. George. After casting the alloy was homogenized for 24 h at 1250 °C. The alloy was then aged at 800 °C for up to 1325 h [18]. An FEI XL30 SEM operated at 15 kV was used to observe microstructural features. Samples for the SEM were ground using silicon carbide papers up to 1200 grit and polished to a mirror finish using 0.3 and 0.05 μm alumina powder in water. Specimens for TEM observation were cut into rectangular bars that were milled into 3-mm diameter cylinders. The cylinders were cut into 3-mm discs and polished to ~150 μm thick. The thin foils were then twin jet elec- tropolished in a solution of 25% nitric acid in methanol using a Struers Tenupol 5 at a voltage of 11 V and current of 100 mA at −20 °C. Microstructural examination of the specimens was performed using a Tecnai F20 FEG TEM operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 keV and equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).Experimental selected area diffraction patterns (SADPs) were simulated using CrystalMaker® 9.1.3 and SingleCrystal® 2.3.1 software. The lattice parameters used to simulate SAD patterns for the matrix (a = 0.361 nm), Laves phase particles (a = 0.482 nm, c = 0.784 nm) and NiAl particles (a = 0.289 nm) were determined from X-ray diffraction from [18]. The value for the Laves phase is comparable to that obtained for (Fe, Cr, Ni)2(Nb, Si) Laves particles (a = 0.476 nm and c = 0.786 nm) in a Fe–15Cr–15Ni–Nb (wt. %) austenitic stainless steel that had additions of Si and other alloying elements [41]. Without 2 wt. % niobium the alloy had a matrix lattice parame- ter of a = 0.3549 nm, and with niobium the austenite lattice expanded to 0.3556 nmDownloaded by [Dartmouth College Library] at 05:54 01 December 2015
Philosophical Magazine 3[41]. A study of deformation behaviour in an AFA steel used a similar lattice parameter of 0.361 nm for the f.c.c. matrix [20]. The Laves lattice parameter noted in this study also falls within the range found in a study of Fe–Ni–Nb, by Takeyama et al. [42] and Denham and Silcock [43]. The lattice parameter of stoichiometric B2-NiAl was reported to be 0.28864 nm [44] and the lattice parameters of Ni-(42-55)Al has been shown to fall in the range of 0.287–0.289 nm [45].Results and discussionOverview of precipitatesLaves phase and B2-NiAl particles in Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al typically appear to grow in distinct directions [7,18,19]. Figure 1 shows SEM backscattered electron (BSE) images of Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al after both solution treatment and a series of ageing treatments at 800 °C. In Figure 1(a), the alloy shows no evidence of precipitation and is single-phase f.c.c. After ageing at 800 °C for 24 h Laves phase particles showing bright contrast have precipitated uniformly in the matrix with a few (dark) B2-NiAl particles present (Figure 1(b)). Three lines are drawn on the image parallel to the long axis of the particles and a circle is drawn for the particles that appear to project out of the image. The Laves phase particles appear to grow in only four directions. In Figure 1(c), the BSE allows one to clearly see the larger, darker contrast B2-NiAl particles that are present at 240 h, which in some instances have grown to be much larger than the Laves phase precipitates. In Figure 1(d), unlike at earlier times, after ageing at 1325 h all NiAl particles that are visible in the matrix are much larger than the Laves phase particles in the matrix. Four lines are drawn on the image parallel to the NiAl particles, suggesting there are at least four growth directions for the NiAl particles.￼￼Figure 1.

4 G. Trotter and I. BakerTEM–EDS results from the particles and matrix are presented in Table 1. The aver- age matrix composition after ageing at 800 °C for 1325 h has decreased amounts of Cr, Ni and Nb, and increased amounts of Fe and Al as compared to the nominal alloy com- position. The B2-NiAl particles primarily consist of Ni (49.9 at. %) and Al (38.1 at. %) with substantial amounts of Fe (9.2 at. %). The values obtained for the B2-NiAl ((Ni, Fe)Al) particles are consistent with the B2-NiAl particle composition observed in a martensitic precipitation hardenable steel where atom probe data also showed a lower Al content and an incorporation of Fe while the Ni content was at 50 at. % [46]. The Fe2Nb ((Fe, Cr, Ni)2Nb) Laves phase particles consisted primarily of Fe (40.3 at. %), Cr (14.2 at. %), Ni (15.4 at. %) and Nb (28 at. %). Similar compositions for Fe2Nb Laves particles were observed by the author [19] and in other works [41,42,47,48]. For example, in a study of the alloy Fe–15Nb–40Ni (at. %) the Laves phase had a composi- tion of Fe-27 at. % Nb-33 at. % Ni [47] and a study of Fe–16.2Cr–14.3Ni–1.2Nb (at. %) [41] described (Fe, Ni, Cr)2(Nb, Si) particles with a composition of Fe–12.6Ni– 11.3Cr–22.9Nb–6.8Si (at. %), indicating a consistency in how the ‘A’ and ‘B’ elements that contribute to the AB2 Laves phase are proportioned.Laves phase crystal structure and orientation relationshipThere are six fundamental four-layer stacking schemes that can be combined to form Laves phase as described by Komura [49] and two four-layer schemes make up the C14 structure. The C14 phase has 12 atoms per unit cell. The stacking of the C14 structure along the (0001) planes is similar to the ...ABAB... stacking sequence observed in hcp structures [50]. There are a number of ways to describe the stacking sequence. For example, as described by Komura [49], the two layers form in the close- packed direction and follow an ...AB′AB′... pattern, described as: αAαcßBßc... where αAαc represents the ‘A’ and ßBßc represents the ‘B’ [51]. Greek letters correspond to large atoms (Nb in Fe2Nb) and Roman letters correspond to smaller atoms (Fe). Figure 2(a) shows a C14 Laves projection onto a (0 0 0 1) plane. Depending on which atoms are chosen to occupy the corner sites of a unit cell, different descriptions of the stacking constructions can be used. For example, Chen et al. [52] describes the AB2 C14 structure with small ‘B’ atoms making up the corners of the unit cell (Figure 2(b)) and consisting of two blocks, B1 and B1′ containing a series of primed and unprimed planes that are twin related Figure 2(c). Figure 2(d) shows the typical representation of a C14 unit cell. Kumar and Hazzledine [24] have an alternate description of the C14 stacking sequence where large atoms occupy the corners of a unit cell (Figure 2(e)). The Laves structure is described as a construction of XY′ quadruple layers which areTable 1.

Each triple layer is 1⁄4 of the thickness of the quadruple layer and contains one atom per unit cell layer. The sin- gle layer contains three small atoms (Figure 2(g)).The orientation relationship between the Laves phase particles and the matrix was investigated via tilting experiments in the TEM. A bright-field image of a hexagonally shaped Laves phase precipitate in the f.c.c. matrix is shown in Figure 3(a). Figure 3(b) and (c) show kikuchi patterns taken from the matrix and a Laves phase precipitate, respectively. Figure 3(d) shows a SADP of the precipitate and matrix. A schematic rep- resentation of the SADP with indexing is shown in Figure 3(e). The six-fold symmetry in Figure 3(e) is consistent with the basal plane of the Laves phase (hexagonal (C14), P63/mmc). The Laves phase precipitate was oriented along the [0 0 0 1] direction while the matrix was at [111]. Based on the diffraction patterns, and simulated results, the orientation relationship between the Fe2Nb precipitate and the austenite matrix for this particle was confirmed to be:ð0 0 0 1ÞFe2Nb==ð1 1 1Þc 1⁄21 0 "1 0 Fe2Nb==1⁄2"1 1 0 cThis is the relationship observed by Denham and Silcock [43] for Laves phase precipi- tates in an f.c.c. alloy with Fe, Cr, Ni, Nb and other minor constituents, and also in a Fe–16.2Cr–14.3Ni–1.2Nb (at. %) alloy with minor alloying additions [41]. The Laves phase precipitate has the close-packed basal (0 0 0 1) planes parallel to the close-packed (111) matrix planes that exhibit three-fold symmetry and a hexagonal pattern. While many particles were observed with the above orientation, a number of variants were observed, which was expected from the observation of particles SEM images (Figure 1).In Figure 4(a), a TEM bright-field image of an elongated Laves particle is shown.

Laves phase parti- cles labelled with a ‘(1)’ or a ‘(2)’ have the same orientation relationships of particles ‘1’ and ‘2’, respectively. The SADP in Figure 5(b) is taken from precipitate ‘1’ and the SADP in Figure 5(c) is taken from precipitate ‘2’. In both SADPs the f.c.c. matrix is at viewed along the [1 0 1] zone axis. Figure 5(d) and (e) shows a representation of the superimposed electron diffraction patterns from both the matrix and the two particles with both particles being viewed along their 1⁄20 "1 1 0  zone axis. Tilting experiments and the correspondence between the image and the electron diffraction pattern of the parti- cles, revealed that the particle whose SADP is shown in Figure 5(b) has an orientation of ð"1 1 1Þm//(0 0 0 1)p, 1⁄20 1 "1 m//1⁄21 0 "1 0 p and that shown in Figure 5(c) has an orientation of ð111Þm//(0001)p, [011]m//1⁄210"10 p.

Figure 7(a–d) shows the stereographic projections of the four variants described above with Laves phase (0001) traces. The Laves phase {0001} traces overlap with the matrix {1 1 1} traces.Particles with a hexagonal shape had the first orientation described above, while those that were more elongated and often plate-like and faceted are seen to grow along the other matrix {111} directions. The calculated diffraction patterns of Figures 4(c), 5(d, e) and 6(c), {0001} Laves and {111} matrix planes are in close proximity to one another, and taken alone, this would suggest that these planes are nearly parallel and that 〈1 1 1〉 are preferred directions for precipitate growth.This observed orientation, according to Denham and Silcock is thought to be governedby the Fe and Nb containing A-layer of the Fe2Nb (AB2) and the attainment of the sameatomic site densities for the matrix and precipitate [43]. In their description of the LavesFe2Nb structure, Fe atoms occupy the corner sites of the C14 unit cell. The stackingsequence along the ‘c’ axis is described as ABAB (Figure 8(a)), and the A layer is a puck-ered layer that consists of Nb and Fe with the Nb atoms at ` 1 z, while the B layer con- 16tains Fe atoms (Figure 8(b)) [43]. The first layer of atoms that make up the basal plane of the Laves phase is coherent with the (1 1 1) matrix plane (Figure 8(c)) which results in a favourably small mismatch in lattice spacing. In their analysis, Denham and Silcock note that if a different orientation relationship occurred where the B layer of iron atoms were coherent instead, the density of atomic sites in the expanded matrix lattice would be 33% greater than in the observed orientation, which leads to the conclusion that it is the density relationship as well as the niobium atoms’ role in nucleation at the reaction front that are the major factors that cause the orientation that is observed. Following the analysis in [43], given the above orientation relationship the f.c.c. matrix contracts by 6% in the 〈1 1 1〉 direction and expands by 9% in the 〈1 1 2〉 direction and the volume expansion on transformation from matrix to precipitate is 12%. As noted by [54] others have successfully concluded the preferred direction of precipitate growth following this methodology, but this is not always an accurate assumption.

In Figure 10(a), one additional NiAl particle Kurdjumov–Sachs variant is observed (to the right of the particle from Figure 9). It was determined to have the ori- entation relationship ð"111Þm//(011)p, [101]m//1⁄2111 p. In Figure 10(b), two B2-NiAl particles and shown with ð1"11Þm//(011)p, [110]m//1⁄2111 p, and ð111Þm//(011)p, [01 1]m//1⁄2"1 1 "1 p variants of the Kurdjumov–Sachs relationship.Unlike with the Laves phase, NiAl particles that appeared to be oriented similarly in bright-field TEM images were observed to occasionally represent different variants of the K–S relationship. For example, Figure 11 shows an analysis of two nearly side- by-side B2-NiAl particles in the matrix. Figure 11(a) is a bright-field TEM image of the two particles in the matrix. Figure 11(b) shows a diffraction from the matrix down the [3 2 3] zone axis. Figure 11(c) and (d) show the diffraction patterns from the two NiAl particles while the matrix is at the [3 2 3] axis. Figure 11(e) and (f) show the simulated diffraction patterns of the two particles. Though the particles appear to be oriented in the same direction based on the TEM bright-field image, their respective diffraction pat- terns reveal that they are two distinct twin-related variants of the K–S relationship hav- ing orientations of ð1"11Þm//(011)p, 1⁄210"1 m//1⁄2111 p, and ð1"11Þm//(011)p, 1⁄210"1 m// 1⁄2"1 1 "1 p, respectively.In studies of the morphology and crystallography of martensite in steels a total of 24 (V1–V24) possible variants have been predicted for the K–S relationship [55–57]. Figure 12 shows the superimposed stereographic projections of the matrix and B2-NiAl particles that have the K–S relationship. {111} and {011} matrix and precipitate planes are plotted on the stereographic projections. In this study, a total of six of the 24 K–S variants were observed:￼￼￼￼￼Downloaded by [Dartmouth College Library] at 05:54 01 December 2015

The K–S-orientation relationship has been seen in an FNCA alloy [30,31] with B2-NiAl precipitates that also had a plate-like morphology. In that case, two K–S-orientation relationship variants were observed. In a study of f.c.c.

In [54] it was predicted that b.c.c. and f.c.c. systems have a lattice parameter ratio between 1.21 and 1.36 would have the K–S relationship. Given the value of 1.25 for the lattice parameter ratio between the f.c.c. matrix and the B2-NiAl in this alloy, it is not surprising that Kx2013; S-orientation is observed for the NiAl precipitates.ConclusionsHexagonal-shaped and elongated Fe2Nb-type Laves phase, and plate-like B2-NiAl pre- cipitates were observed after a solution anneal at 1250 °C followed by ageing at 800 °C in Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al. The orientation between the f.c.c. matrix and Laves phase was determined to have the (1 1 1)m//(0 0 0 1)p, 1⁄2"1 1 0 m//1⁄21 0 "1 0 p orientation relationship proposed by Denham and Silcock. The B2-NiAl precipitates were determined to have a Kurdjumov–Sachs-orientation relationship with the matrix, i.e. (1 1 1)m//(0 1 1)p, 1⁄2"101 m//1⁄2111 p. While the Laves phase particles primarily followed four variants, six variants of the K–S-orientation were observed for the B2-NiAl particles.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation Grant DMR 1206240.

Abstract
In order to achieve energy conversion efficiencies of &gt;50 % for steam turbines/boilers in power generation systems, materials required are strong, corrosion-resistant at high temperatures (&gt;700°C), and economically viable.  Austenitic steels strengthened with Laves phase and Ni3Al precipitates, and alloyed with aluminum to improve oxidation resistance, are potential candidate materials for these applications.  The creep resistance of these alloys is significantly improved through intermetallic strengthening (Laves-Fe2Nb + L12-Ni3Al precipitates) without harmful effects on oxidation resistance.   

This research starts with microstructural and microchemical analyses of these intermetallic strengthened alumina-forming austenitic steels in a scanning electron microscope.  The microchemistry of precipitates, as determined by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope, is also studied.  Different thermo-mechanical treatments were carried out to these stainless steels in an attempt to further improve their mechanical properties.  The microstructural and microchemical analyses were again performed after the thermo-mechanical processing. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction was used to measure the lattice parameters of these steels after different thermo-mechanical treatments. Tensile tests at both room and elevated temperatures were performed to study mechanical behaviors of this novel alloy system; the deformation mechanisms were studied by strain rate jump tests at elevated temperatures.  Failure analysis and post-mortem TEM analysis were performed to study the creep failure mechanisms of these alumina-forming austenitic steels after creep tests. Experiments were carried out to study the effects of boron and carbon additions in the aged alumina-forming austenitic steels.

Chapter 1 Introduction


1.1 Background
            The energy efficiency of fossil-fired boiler/steam turbine power plants is strongly dependent on the operation temperature and pressure. An effective way to enhance the energy conversion efficiency of fossil fuel power plants is to increase their operating temperature and pressure. The operating temperature and pressure of current ultra-supercritical (USC) power plants are 600ºC/25MPa and this will eventually increase to 700ºC/35MPa and then later to 760ºC/35MPa for the next generation of advanced ultra-supercritical (A-USC) power plants [1-4]. Another benefit to running such power plants at higher temperatures and pressures is the reduction of CO2 emissions and carbon footprint. A key factor to achieve this is the materials of construction for boilers and steam turbines [5-7].  The materials used for the boiler/steam turbine in a A-USC power plant must be able to withstand not only this high operating temperature, but also have excellent oxidation and corrosion resistance, and most importantly be of low cost [8, 9].  Extensive efforts are underway to develop materials with high temperature strength, oxidation resistance/corrosion resistance, and low cost [10-12].  High-nickel alloy and nickel-based superalloy meet all the performance goals, but they are too expensive to use due to the high content of nickel [13-15].
             Heat-resistant FeNi-based austenitic stainless steels could potentially be used for USC power plants due to their good creep, good oxidation resistance and relatively low cost. However, they rely on the formation of chromia (Cr2O3) as the surface protection layer and chromia starts to lose its protective capability under aggressive environments at temperature above ~650ºC [16-18].  Ferritic FeCrAl alloys are available for long time applications due to their outstanding high temperature oxidation and corrosion resistance. But, they have poor creep resistance at temperature above 600ºC because of their open body-centered-cubic (b.c.c.) structure [18]. Face-centered-cubic (f.c.c.) austenitic stainless steels are the primary potential materials of construction for this high temperature application. They have a combination of high temperature (&gt;600ºC) creep strength, oxidation resistance and a lower cost because of a lower Ni content (~20 wt.% of Ni) [7, 19].  
1.2 Alumina Forming Austenitic Stainless Steels
            Recently, a family of inexpensive, high creep strength, alumina forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels has been developed [7, 20-29].  The materials have creep rupture lifetimes above 2000 hours at 750ºC and 100MPa, and good oxidation resistance at 650ºC (10 % water vapor) in air [7].  
           These alloys fall in a broad composition range of Fe-(12-15)Cr-(12-35)Ni-(2.5-4)Al -(0.6-3)Nb wt.% with addition of Al, Cr, Mn and Ni to maintain a single austenitic matrix phase [18]. They use MC carbides (M is mainly Nb) and M23C6 (M is mainly Cr, Nb) [24, 30] or L12-Ni3Al precipitates [31] as the main strengthening particles to enhance the creep performance.  Among them, the alloys based on Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-3Al-2Ti wt.% showed outstanding creep resistance at 650ºC and can be used as structural components in aggressive oxidation conditions [31]. The small amount of Al forms a protective alumina scale, which has superior thermodynamic stability over a chromia scale [12, 21, 32, 33].  Conventional heat-resistant stainless steels depend on chromia scale at elevated temperatures.  However, the chromia protection scale is compromised in the presence of water vapor, carbon, or sulfur oxidizing species [12, 32].  These aggressive species will accelerate oxidation kinetics and the material loss rate. An alumina protective scale grows at an order of magnitude lower rate than chromia scale in air [22].  Lots of effort has been spent on developing these alumina forming austenitic stainless steels.  However, in the past none of them has exhibited both high temperature creep strength and oxidation resistance.  This is due to the strong body-centered-cubic (b.c.c.) stabilizing effect of Al on Fe and the inability to maintain a single phase iron f.c.c. matrix, resulting in the  loss of the creep strength [8, 10, 30, 34, 35].  The significance of the recent development of alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels is the discovery that the alumina protective scale can be formed at 650ºC to 800ºC with 2.5 wt.% Al [7, 22, 25, 30], as shown in Figure 1.1


Figure 1.1 An alumina protective scale formed on the surface of alumina forming austenitic stainless steels (Fe-20Ni-14Cr-2.5Al wt.%) from reference [36].
            Multiple precipitates are observed in these alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels, mainly a Fe2Nb-type Laves phase, NiAl-type B2 phase, Ni3Al-type L12 phase, and MC carbide phase [30]. The amount of these secondary phases (Laves and B2 phase) depends mainly on the level of Al and Nb contents in the alloy system.  The addition of Nb is necessary to enhance the stability of alumina scale formed at a high temperature.  This results in forming the Fe2Nb Laves phase (C14) [7, 22, 25, 29].  The Fe2Nb Laves phase precipitates are thermally stable up to 1627ºC.  They are expected to be in equilibrium with NbC and the iron f.c.c. matrix [21, 24].  After aging treatment at 750ºC, NiAl type B2 phase precipitates (rod-like particles) with dark contrast can also be observed.   It has been reported that the B2 phase precipitates are not effective at improving the high temperature strength of austenitic stainless steels above 400ºC [11, 27].  However, they may enhance the creep resistance by affecting dislocation climb.  Creep testing at 750ºC results in a finer and denser distribution of these secondary precipitates than an aged alloy. These finer second phase precipitations are effective at increasing creep strength of alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels [30].  The B2-NiAl phase precipitates also play an important role in the oxidation resistance since they can work as an Al reservoir for forming an alumina scale at high temperatures [37].  
            Both Fe2Nb Laves phase and NiAl B2 phase precipitates demonstrate limited effects on the high temperature strength at or above 650ºC [29].  The development of the alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels is focused on introducing nanoscale precipitates like Ni3Al type L12 and MC carbide precipitates [29, 30].  Figure 1.2 shows a typical TEM bright-field image and selected area diffraction pattern of the Ni3Al type L12 precipitates in a Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-3Al-2Ti wt.% alloy. 


Figure 1.2 (a) TEM bright-field image a Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-3Al-2Ti wt.% alloy strengthened by coherent Ni3Al type L12 precipitates; b) is the selected area diffraction pattern taken from this alloy from reference [31].  
            Coherent Ni3Al precipitates are effective for improving the high temperature mechanical properties in various nickel-and iron-based superalloys.  One example is the commercially-available iron-based superalloy A286.  A286 shows good creep properties due to the formation of coherent Ni3Ti type L12 phase at a temperature of ~730ºC.  But, the strengthening effect is limited because the L12 phase is metastable at higher temperatures [38, 39].  Coherent Ni3Al phase precipitates were reported previously in alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels [23].  These alloys were further optimized recently to maximize the stability of coherent L12 precipitates for better creep performance [29]. MC carbides (M: mainly Nb) are particles with a size of ~10 nm. They are effective at increasing the creep resistance by pinning dislocations in the iron f.c.c. matrix [21, 30].  
            Cold work is also effective for improving the creep properties of these alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels [30, 40-42].  The dislocations introduced during the cold rolling process act as nucleation sites for precipitates and results in doubled creep lives for these alloys at 750ºC [21, 24].  Trotter et al. [43] studied the effects of cold work on the microstructural evolution during aging of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at.%).  It was found that 90% cold work and aging at 800ºC not only caused a rapid precipitation of both Laves phase and B2-type NiAl precipitates, but also increased the total volume fraction of precipitates and hardness compared to the materials which had been simply aged.
             Recently, Tarigan et al. [44, 45] studied the grain boundary Laves phase strengthening mechanism in long term creep in an aluminum-free austenitic heat-resistant steel Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at.%). It was found that the creep resistance increases with increasing area fraction of grain boundary Laves phase precipitates. Dislocation pile-ups were also observed near grain boundary Laves phase, which was effective in suppressing the local deformation by preventing dislocation motion.
             Boron is also found to improve the creep strength in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at.%) by increasing the extent of the Laves phase at the grain boundaries [44, 45].  Simply aging the boron-free alloy to increase the extent of grain boundary coverage by the Laves phase from 52 % to 89 % increased the creep rupture life, and decreased the creep rate to a similar extent as the boron addition. 
             Yamamoto et al. [31] studied the additions of both carbon and boron on improving the creep and oxidation properties of Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-3-4Al-1-3Ti (wt.%).  It was found 0.1% wt.% carbon alone can’t improve the creep performance. The boron addition was associated with the improvement of creep properties. The creep test results are shown in Figure 1.3. It was hypothesized that the strain field between L12 phase and matrix caused the improvement of creep properties of this alloy. 

Figure 1.3  (a) oxidation test results at 800ºC in 10 % water vapor and (b) creep-rupture curves at 750ºC and 100 MPa (32Z stands for Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-0.15Si-3Al-2Ti-0.3Zr (wt.%) without carbon and boron, while 32ZCB is the same alloy with carbon and boron) [31].
            Chen et al. also studied Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at.%) with and without 0.03 at.% B and found that boron both increased the extent and produced finer Laves phase precipitates on the grain boundaries. The grain boundary coverage in the boron-doped alloy increased to 83 % upon aging at 800ºC for 24 h (compare to 75 % with boron-free alloy).  Using EPMA, they showed strong boron segregation to the grain boundaries.  They found that for both the boron-doped and boron-free alloy, longer aging times prior to creep testing increased the creep life and that for the same aging time boron doping increased the creep life by producing greater grain boundary coverage of the Laves phase. Their results were similar to those in previous studies by Tarigan et al. [46].  Essentially, boron appears to reduce the annealing time needed to obtain large grain boundary coverage by the Laves phase.
1.3 Outline of Research Project
            This thesis discusses the microstructure and mechanical properties of recently developed alumina forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels, specifically the Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-3Al-2Ti wt.% based AFA alloy after two kinds of thermo-mechanical treatments (TMTs).  The microstructure and room temperature mechanical properties of the TMT alloys will be discussed in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 will discuss the elevated temperature mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms. 
             In Chapter 5, the effect of boron and carbon addition to the aged AFA alloy will be outlined. The microstructure and elevated temperature mechanical properties were studied to explore influence of boron addition.
             Chapter 6 will discuss the characterizations of recently-developed AFA alloys after creep testing performed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).
             Chapter 7 is the summary and conclusions of this research project. Future work is also suggested

            Two TMTs of the DAFA29 were performed in an attempt to produce finer and uniformly distributed precipitates as shown in Figure 2.1 [47].  In the first approach (referred to as Method #1), the DAFA29 was cold rolled to a 90 % reduction in thickness with a ~4.5 % reduction per pass, and then annealed at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h.  In the second approach (referred to as Method #2), the alloy is given a solutionizing anneal at 1200ºC and then cold rolled to a 90 % reduction in thickness with a ~4.5 % reduction per pass before annealing at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h.

2.3 Materials Characterization
2.3.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy
        Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using an FEI XL-30 field emission gun (FEG) scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an electron backscatter detector (EBSD) and an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The EDS system utilizes a lithium-drifted silicon, thin-window detector that detects Z ≥ 4 with acquisition rates up to 10,000 counts per second. The operation voltage was 15 keV and the working distance was 10 mm for imaging and EDS.
2.3.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy
            A Tecnai F20 FEG transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 200 keV was extensively used to complete the microstructural characterization and dislocation configurations. Discs of 3 mm diameter were first produced by electro-discharge machining (EDM), and then ground to ~200 µm thick and twin jet electropolished in an electrolyte of 20% nitric acid, 10% butoxyethanol and 70% methanol using a Streurs Tenupol 5 at a voltage of ~10 V with a current of ~40 mA at ~260 K. After electropolishing, specimens were washed alternatively in ethanol and methanol for three cycles followed by a final rinse in fresh methanol. The resulting thin foils were examined using a conventional double-tilt holder with a capability of tilting 60° along two axes.  A CCD camera with 2048 × 2048 pixels was used to record images. Bright filed (BF), dark field (DF) images were taken under two-beam conditions with the deviation factor slightly greater than zero.
2.3.3 Mechanical Tests
            Tensile test specimens were milled to dog-bone geometry with a gauge length of 10 mm, width of 2.65 mm, thickness of 0.8 mm, and polished to a mirror finish using 800 grit silicon carbide papers followed by 0.3 μm alumina powder.
            After thermo-mechanical processing, room temperature tensile tests were performed with a Hydraulic MTS testing machine.  A preload force of 50 N was applied before the tensile tests were started.  The initial strain rate for all tensile tests was 5×10-4 s-1.  The elongations were measured directly from the specimens after the tensile tests.
            In order to compare the simple annealed samples (without cold rolling) to thermo-mechanical treated DAFA29, another two group of DAFA29 alloys were annealed as control samples. The first group (Method #1 control) samples were annealed at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h. The second group (Method #2 control) samples were annealed at 1200ºC and then post annealed at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h.  The room temperature tensile tests of these two groups of control samples were also performed under the same test conditions.
            Elevated temperature (600ºC, 700ºC and 800ºC) tensile tests were performed in air with an Instron 5690 tensile testing machine and a MTS hydraulic testing machine.  A preload force of 50 N was applied before the tensile tests.  The initial strain rate for all tensile tests was 5 × 10-4 s-1. Elongations were measured directly from the gauge of the specimens after the tensile tests. All the tensile tests were performed three times for each specimen. The resulting test data are shown as true stress- true strain curves.
            Strain rate jump tests were also performed on the same tensile test machine at 600ºC and 700ºC. A preload force of 50 N was again applied before the strain rate jump tests were started. The initial strain rate for all strain rate jump tests was 5 × 10-5 s-1. 
2.3.4 Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction 
           Thin foil specimens were polished from 200 μm thick disks to a thickness of 20 μm for synchrotron XRD measurements. The XRD experiments were performed at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory with the X-ray microdiffraction facility at undulator beamline 2-ID-D [30].  X-ray photons with energy of 18 keV (wavelength = 0.688 nm) were selected using a Si &lt;111&gt; double-crystal monochromator, and then focused to a circular spot of ~400 nm through a Fresnel zone plate. The diffraction signals were collected with a Rayonix Mar165 CCD detector, with 2048×2048 pixels and 80 micron pixel size, located ~58 mm downstream of the sample. The total counting time was 55 seconds. Over this counting period, the sample was continuously rotated around an axis perpendicular to the incident beam by 110 deg.













Chapter 3 Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of as-received and Thermo-mechanical Treated Alumina-forming Austenitic Stainless Steels


3.1 Introduction
            This Chapter investigated the effect of thermo-mechanical treatments on the microstructure and room temperature mechanical properties of recently-developed AFA stainless steels, specifically the Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-3Al-2Ti wt.% based AFA alloys.  During the treatments, the as-received AFA alloys was cold rolled to a 90 % thickness reduction (both with and without a solutionizing anneal at 1200ºC) and then heat treated at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h. Detailed microstructural analysis was performed on the samples before and after two thermo-mechanical treatments by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD). 
            In order to better understand the strengthening mechanisms at room temperature. Analytical simulation was carried out to study the effect of grain boundary strengthening and precipitate strengthening using Hall-Petch equations.
3.2 Experimental
            The details of fabrication and processing of AFA stainless steel, referred to as DAFA29, are described in Chapter 2.  The nominal and analyzed chemistry of the DAFA29 is given in Table 2.1.  
            Two thermo-mechanical treatments of the DAFA29 were performed and the details of the process are presented in experimental section in previous Chapter.  
            In order to compare the simple annealed samples (without cold rolling) to thermo-mechanical treated DAFA29, another two group of DAFA29 alloys were treated as control samples. The first group (Method #1 control) samples were annealed at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h without any cold rolling. The second group (Method #2 control) samples were solutionizing annealed at 1200ºC and then post annealed at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h without cold rolling.  The room temperature tensile tests of these two groups of control samples were also performed under the same test conditions. Figure 3.1 shows the flowchart of control samples compared to initial thermo-mechanical treatments.

3.3 Results and Discussion
3.3.1 As-received Microstructures
            A backscattered electron (BSE) image of as received DAFA29 showing the grain structure and the precipitates is shown in Figure 3.2a. EDS data acquired from the precipitates and the matrix are shown in Figures 3.2b and 3.2c, respectively.  The white precipitates are niobium enriched consistent with a Fe2Nb Laves phase.  The Laves phase precipitates are aligned along the rolling direction, as shown in Figure 3.2a (white arrow). They are observed both on the grain boundary as well in the interior of the grains.  The size of these Laves phase is in the range 0.5-10 μm.  Previous research suggested the strengthening effect of Laves phase strongly depends on its size and distribution [23].  Further refinement and stabilization of the Fe2Nb particle sizes to ~100 nm is needed to obtain better creep resistance [23]. MC carbides (M: Nb, Ti) are also observed in DAFA29. These precipitates are randomly distributed in the matrix with a size of ~5 μm.  They normally have a blocky morphology.  The predicted volume fraction of this phase is around 1% based on JMatPro simulation. 

Figure 3.2 The BSE image of as-received DAFA29, and EDS from b) and c) niobium-enriched precipitates, and d) the matrix.  The rolling direction is indicated.
            A bright field (BF) TEM image of a precipitate in DAFA29 located on the edge of a thin foil is shown in Figure 3.3a.  A selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern taken from the f.c.c. matrix (lower circle in Figure 3.3a) is shown in Figure 3.3b.  The diffraction pattern consists of two sets of different diffraction spots, which are superimposed diffraction patterns from the L12 phase and the f.c.c. matrix. The weak diffraction spots are superlattice reflections from the L12 phase, whereas the strong diffraction spots are from both the fundamental reflections from an L12 phase and from the f.c.c. matrix.  The orientation relationship between the L12 phase and the f.c.c. matrix is cube-on-cube.  The superlattice reflection is similar to the diffraction spots observed in previous studies on similar alloys strengthened by nanoscale coherent L12-ordered intermetallic γ'-Ni3(Al, Ti) precipitates [48].  A convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) pattern from the large precipitate viewed along [0001] (after tilting) is shown Figure 3.3c.  It shows a hexagonal pattern.  Based on this result and previous EDS results (Figure 3.2b), it is confirmed that this precipitate is the Fe2Nb Laves phase.

3.3.2 Microstructures of Thermo-mechanically Processed DAFA29
            In order to produce fine and uniformly distributed Laves phase precipitates, two thermo-mechanical treatments were used to process DAFA29, as shown in Figure 3.1.  Previous research reported that cold rolling (with 10 % thickness reduction) of precipitate-strengthened austenitic stainless steels could improve creep properties, because the dislocations introduced by cold rolling acted as nucleation sites for fine MC (NbC) carbide precipitates, resulting in enhanced creep resistance [21, 42, 49].  It should be noted that the alloys examined here (DAFA29) can be cold rolled to more than 90 % thickness reduction, indicating that the coarse second phase precipitates do not degrade room temperature workability of the AFA alloys, similar to the results previously reported in [30]. 
            BSE images of DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1 are shown in Figure 3.4.  The steel was cold rolled to a 90 % reduction in thickness, after which it is evident that the large Laves phase precipitates had fractured (Figure 3.4b inset). These samples were then annealed at 800°C for 2.4 h (Figure 3.4c), 24 h (Figure 3.4d), or 240 h (Figure 3.4e).  The cold rolling fractured many of the Laves phase precipitates in the matrix resulting in smaller precipitates (Figure 3.4c, d and e).

Figure 3.4 BSE images of DAFA29 showing fracturing of the Laves phase after cold rolling: (a) as-received, (b) after cold rolling (90 % thickness reduction), and after annealing at 800ºC for (c) 2.4 h, (d) 24 h, or (e) 240 h.
            BSE images of DAFA 29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #2 are shown in Figure 3.5.  The aim of using this method is to solutionize the large Laves phase precipitates before cold rolling. Unfortunately, the large Laves phase precipitates could not be completely solutionized at 1200 ºC, although the annealing significantly reduced their volume fraction from 4 % to 2 % (compare Figures 3.5a and 3.5b).  The solutionizing anneal also produced a substantial increase in the average grain size from 40 to 250 μm (all grain size was measured using the linear line intercept method).  As observed for thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1, the residual large Laves phase precipitates also fractured during the cold rolling.  Upon subsequent annealing, the size of the residual Laves phase precipitates did not change significantly.  After the 240 h anneal, fine-scale particles precipitated out and were evenly distributed in the matrix (Figure 3.5f).  These new precipitates presumably nucleated on the dislocations generated during the 90 % cold rolling.  The inset in Figure 3.5f clearly shows precipitates with two different types of brighter contrast, white and light gray, likely due to the presence of two different phase compositions.  The light gray phase is likely the Laves phase and the dark gray phase is likely B2 NiAl.  These small precipitates were also observed in previous research on AFA alloys [21, 24].

Figure 3.5 BSE images of DAFA29: (a) as-received, (b) after a solutionizing anneal of 50 h at 1200ºC, (c) after a subsequent 90 % cold rolling reduction, and (c) after solutionizing, cold rolling, and annealing at 800ºC for (d) 2.4 h, (e) 24 h, or (f) 240 h.
            Table 3.1 shows the average size of the Laves phase precipitates after both thermo-mechanical treatments using the particle size image analysis technique used by Trotter et al. [50].  The sizes of the Laves phase precipitates are in the range 167-562 nm, i.e.: much smaller than the large Laves phase precipitates in Figures 3.2 and 3.3 which are 0.5-10 µm.  As the annealing times increases from 2.4 h to 240 h, the size of Laves phase increases from 167 nm to 417 nm for the samples treated by Method#1.  The size of Laves phase in materials treated with Method#2 is slightly larger than those treated by Method#1 for all annealing times.  This is due to the extra step of solutionizing in Method#2.

            Comparing Figures 3.4 and 3.5, the BSE images of the samples after solutionizing anneal show fewer Laves phase precipitates.  This is especially clear in Figure 3.5f, where the large Laves phase precipitates are barely observed.  Instead, the small precipitates are uniformly distributed in the matrix.  The solutionizing annealing used in Method #2 is an effective way to reduce the size and redistribute the Laves phase precipitates, resulting in a finer and denser distribution.  Most of the small Laves phase precipitates appeared to be coupled with B2 NiAl precipitates. Figure 3.6 shows a BSE image of the precipitates.  Based on EDS results, the brighter contrast precipitates are either Laves phase or MC carbides and the darker contrast precipitates are B2 NiAl precipitates. The B2 NiAl normally co-precipitates with the Laves phase during the thermo-mechanical treatment process. Such finer and denser distributed Laves phase and B2 NiAl precipitates (size are less than 1 μm) may be effective in further increasing the creep strength [30].

            BF TEM images and SAD patterns of DAFA 29 after cold rolling and annealing at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h (Method #1) are shown in Figure 3.7.  After the 2.4 h anneal many small grains with an average grain size of ~100 nm are present. The SAD pattern shows diffraction rings (Figure 3.7d), a feature characteristic of fine-scale f.c.c. grains having many different orientations.  As the annealing time is increased from 2.4 to 240 h, the grain size increased from ~100 nm to ~1μm.  The diffraction patterns changed accordingly as the number of grains captured within the SAD aperture decreased resulting in a single crystal diffraction pattern from a single grain.

            In conventional steels, elongated grains and/or aligned second-phase particles parallel to the rolling direction are developed after large strain cold rolling [51, 52].  For the AFA steels, no elongated grains are observed.  Instead, a large number of irregular nanoscale grains are observed in TEM of the 90 % cold rolled material after 2.4 h annealing, indicating that all the grains are fully recrystallized after the 2.4 h annealing process.
            BF TEM images and SAD patterns of DAFA29 after a solutionizing anneal at 1200ºC, cold rolling, and then annealing at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h (Method #2) are shown in Figure 3.8.  For the sample annealed for 2.4 h, many small grains are observed with an average grain size of ~200 nm with the SAD pattern exhibiting diffraction rings (Figure 8d).  This is similar to 2.4 h samples after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1, where fine grains (~200 nm) are produced by cold rolling and annealing for 2.4 h.  As the annealing time increases from 2.4 to 240 h, the grain size increases from ~200 nm to ~2 μm.

            Comparing Figures 3.7 and 3.8, the average grain size produced by Method #2 is ~2 times larger than produced by Method #1, which is due to grain growth during the solutionizing anneal process.  This annealing step increases the average grain size of DAFA29 from 40 to 250 μm. 
            After thermo-mechanical treatment, the multiple second phase precipitates in treated DAFA29 were studied by TEM/EDS/CBED.
            A BF TEM image and EDS spectrum from a Laves phase precipitate in DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1 annealed for 240 h are shown in Figure 3.9.  The Laves phase precipitates appear darker than the matrix in the TEM image due to their greater thickness and/or compositional difference (heavy element Nb), and, hence, greater absorption. The inset in Figure 3.9a shows a CBED pattern from the circled region. The diffraction pattern indicates a hexagonal crystal structure aligned at [0001] direction.  EDS results from the same region of the Laves phase precipitate, Figure 3.9b, indicate that it is enriched in Nb and Fe.  The EDS data shows an atomic ratio of Fe to Nb of approximately 2:1, consistent with Fe2Nb precipitates, although the precipitates also contain some other elements.

            The creep resistance of the alloys strengthened by Fe2Nb Laves phase particles alone was previously found to be relatively low at 750ºC and 100 MPa in air, which was attributed to the relatively coarse size of the Fe2Nb precipitates [21].  Both large size and small size Fe2Nb precipitates can be observed in DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1, as shown in Figure 3.9.  These newly formed small Laves phase precipitates (~1 μm) might be helpful to enhance the creep performance. 
            A BF TEM image and EDS results from a NiAl precipitate in DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1 and annealed for 240 h are shown in Figure 3.10. The CBED pattern in Figure 3.10b inset corresponds to a B2 structure viewed along the [211] zone axis.  EDS analysis results from the circled region of the NiAl precipitate are shown in Figure 3.10b.  Although the precipitates are mostly Ni and Al, they also contain other elements.  The NiAl precipitates are observed after both thermo-mechanical treatments. They are not present in the as-received DAFA29.  A previous study suggested this B2 phase is likely to increase the creep resistance by affecting dislocation climb in the f.c.c. matrix due to their resistance to dislocation cutting during creep deformation [24, 30].

            The B2 phase precipitates also play an important role for the oxidation resistance of the alloy and work as Al reservoirs, which provide Al to maintain the protective alumina scale on the material’s surface at high temperature [30].
            A BF TEM image and EDS results from a Ni3Al precipitate on the edge of a thin foil from DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1 and annealed 240 h are shown in Figure 3.11.  The Ni3Al precipitates are spherical with a diameter less than 100 nm.  The inset in Figure 3.11a shows a CBED pattern from the circled region of theNi3Al precipitate.  This corresponds to a pattern from an L12 structure viewed along the [212] zone axis.  EDS data acquired from the region circled in TEM image of this precipitate is shown in Figure 3.11b.  The atomic ratio of Ni to Al(Ti) is approximately 3:1, with small amounts of other elements present. 

Figure 3.11 (a) BF TEM image, (b) EDS spectrum, and CBED pattern from a Ni3Al precipitate in DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1, annealed 240 h.
            The average size of the L12 precipitates in this heat-treated alloy is ~84 nm, which is about eight times larger than in the as-received alloy.  These L12 precipitates have a similar size to the Ni3Al observed in the AFA alloy after creep tests of 3008 h at 750ºC and 100 MPa [48].  Besides the spherical L12 precipitates, no other nanoscale particles, such as carbides or borides, are observed after the thermo-mechanical treatments.
            MC carbide (M: Nb, Ti) precipitates are also observed in DAFA29 both before and after thermo-mechanical treatments.  Figure 3.12 shows a secondary electron image of MC carbides in one thermo-mechanical treated DAFA29 sample. The upper inset in Figure 3.12b is an EBSD pattern, indicating that this is the [011] zone axis of a f.c.c. precipitate. Both the pattern and EDS results show this is an MC precipitate.

            Since the lattice parameters of the f.c.c. matrix and L12 precipitates are similar, synchrotron XRD was used to determine their respective lattice parameters in the alloy. Synchrotron XRD results from the DAFA29 samples after a 1200ºC solutionizing anneal for 50 h, 90 % cold rolling, and then an 800ºC anneal for 240 h, are shown in Figure 3.13.  The 240 h annealed samples were selected for this measurement because the size of precipitates is larger due to particle coarsening, and hence, the XRD signal will be stronger than in the 24 or 2.4 h annealed samples.  In the XRD pattern, the Miller indices of the f.c.c. peaks are labeled in blue, the L12 superlattice peaks are labeled in red, the Laves phase peaks are labeled in black, and B2 peaks are labeled in green.

Figure 3.13 Synchrotron XRD results for DAFA29 after a 1200ºC solutionizing anneal for 50 h followed by 90 % cold roll and an 800ºC anneal for 240 h.  The inset shows the region from ~38° to ~46° expanded.
            The lattice parameters for each phase were calculated based on the highest angle peaks of each phase. The calculated lattice parameters for the phases in the 240 h annealed sample were: the L12 phase is equal to 3.609 Å, the f.c.c. matrix is equal to 3.599 Å, and the NiAl phase is equal to 2.892 Å. The lattice misfit between the L12 precipitates and the f.c.c. matrix was only 0.28 % after the 240 h heat treatment, indicating that very small elastic strain (~0.28 %) between the precipitates and the f.c.c. matrix is developed.
3.3.3 Mechanical Properties of Thermo-mechanical Processed DAFA
            The room temperature tensile test results for DAFA29 after the two different thermo-mechanical treatments are shown in Figure 3.14. The samples in Figure 3.14a were cold rolled and then annealed at 800ºC for different times.  The yield strength and plastic strain to failure of as-received DAFA29 are 560 MPa and 22 %, respectively.  The yield strength increased to 1280 MPa and the plastic strain decreased to 5.1 % after cold rolling and a 2.4 h anneal.  The yield strength decreased with further annealing; the yield strength of the sample after a 24 h anneal was 1070 MPa, and was reduced to 800 MPa when the sample was annealed for 240 h. Surprisingly, the strain to failure for all the cold rolled and annealed samples did not change significantly as the annealing time increased and the yield strength decreased.

Figure 3.14 Tensile test results for DAFA29 after the two different thermo-mechanical treatments.  (a) Samples are treated under Method #1 compared to as-hot-rolled DAFA29, (b) Samples are treated under Method #2 compared to as-hot-rolled DAFA29, (c) Samples are treated under Method #1 without cold rolling, and (d) two step annealed samples without cold rolling compared to as-hot-rolled DAFA29
            The samples shown in Figure 3.14b were treated with the additional step of a solutionizing anneal before cold rolling.  Again, the yield strength increased to 1150 MPa and the plastic strain decreases to 6.2 % after this treatment followed by a 2.4 h anneal. The yield strength decreased to 1020 MPa for an increase in the annealing time to 24 h, and was further reduced to 750 MPa after an anneal for 240 h. Again, the strain to failure for the samples treated by this method did not change significantly after cold rolling and different annealing times.
            The room temperature yield strengths of these treated DAFA29 specimens are four times higher than previous solution heat treated AFA alloys and two times higher than the aged AFA alloys studied in [30].  This difference is mainly due to the nm-scale or µm-scale grains generated after either thermo-mechanical treatment.  Comparison between Figures 3.14a and 3.14b reveals that the solutionizing anneal is not effective in enhancing the tensile strength of DAFA29, although it is helpful to reduce the size of Laves phase and produce a finer and denser distribution of the Laves phase precipitates.
            The tensile test results of the DAFA29 control samples after thermal treatment (Method #1 without cold work) are shown in Figure 3.14c.  Simply, the control samples are annealed at 800ºC for different periods without any cold work.  The yield strength increased to 747 MPa from 560 MPa and the plastic strain decreased slightly to 20 % after a 2.4 h anneal.  The yield strength further increased to 890 MPa and the plastic strain decreased to 10 % after a 24 h anneal.  For a 240 h annealing time, the yield strength decreased to 760 MPa, while the plastic strain still continued to decrease to 8 %.
            For comparison, the tensile test results for DAFA29 control samples after using the thermal treatment (Method #2 without cold work) are shown in Figure 3.14d.  Basically, the control samples are solutionized anneal at 1200ºC followed by anneal at 800ºC for different periods without any cold work.  The results show that all the samples after this two-step annealing are brittle and exhibit no plastic strain.  The yield strength is slightly higher than that of the as-hot-rolled DAFA29 of 560 MPa.
            In order to better understand the correlation between the grain size and the room temperature mechanical properties obtained, the Hall-Petch relation for all treated DAFA29 alloys was determined as shown in Figure 3.15.  The yield strength of the thermo-mechanically treated steel obeys a Hall-Petch relationship between the yield strength σ0.2 and the grain size D, i.e.: σ0.2= σ0 + KD-0.5, where σ0 = 558 MPa and K = 254 MPa•μm-0.5 for the Method#1 alloys and σ0 = 535 MPa and K = 284 MPa•μm-0.5 for the Method#2 alloys, according to the linear fit to the yield strength versus D-0.5.  The value of σ0 differs considerably from that obtained in a 63 % cold rolled AISI 301 austenitic stainless steel [53] of 252 MPa (the values of K was 270 MPa•μm-0.5, similar to this work). The Method#1 alloys show a slightly higher off-set stress σ0 than Method#2 alloys which might be due to the different precipitate size in these two alloys. 

Figure 3.15 A plot of Hall-Petch relationship for DAFA29 after the two different thermo-mechanical treatments
            The stress σ0 can be described, in general, as the sum of several strengthening mechanisms: 1) precipitate strengthening (σppt), 2) strain hardening (σd), and 3) solid solution strengthening (σss) [53].  The off-set stress can be expressed as 
σ0 = σppt+ σd+σss                                                                           (3.1)
            The large σ0 observed in the current work likely arises from substantial precipitate strengthening from the finely spaced L12-Ni3Al precipitates.  The estimated σppt is ~289 MPa according to the Equation 3.2 and 3.3 (based on the Orowan looping mechanism) in [9].
                                     (3.2)
            where G is the shear modulus (MPa), b is the burgers vector (nm), d is the particle diameter (nm), and L is the particle spacing (nm).  For this calculation, a shear modulus of 80,000 MPa and a burgers vector of 0.25 nm were used.  The particle diameter used for the calculation is 84 nm. The equation 3.2 can be converted to the following equation: 
                                          (3.3)
            where f is the precipitate volume fraction and 10.8 is in the unit of MPa·nm. The volume percent of L12 Ni3Al precipitates is 21 % [48].  According this calculation, the precipitate strengthening σppt contributes almost half of the value of the off-set stress σ0.  Note the value of σppt is variable and depends on the precipitates size and dislocation-precipitate interaction mechanism.
            BSE images of the cross-sections of the strained microstructure for DAFA29 after treatment with Method#1, Method#2, Method#1 without cold rolling, and Method#2 without cold rolling are shown in Figures 3.16a-d, respectively.  Figure 3.16e-h are the corresponding BSE images of the fracture surface of those four samples. In the sample treated with Method#1 the large Laves phase fractured perpendicular to the applied stress direction (Figure 3.16a).  The fracture surface shows small dimples with Laves and/or B2 phase in the dimple center (Figure 3.16e). Large Laves phase and MC carbide are also observed on fracture surface in this sample. In the sample treated with Method#2 (Figure 3.16b and f), the fracture surface shows small dimples similar to Figure 3.16e with size of 1 to 2 µm.  In the sample treated with Method#1 without cold rolling (Figure 16c and g), grain boundary precipitates are generated after annealing for 240 h.  Larger cracks are observed along the grain boundaries. The fracture surface indicates the failures are both on grain boundaries and in the matrix. Both fine grain boundary precipitates and large dimples are observed. For the sample treated with Method#2 without cold rolling (Figure 3.16d and h), Laves phase precipitates (exhibiting bright contrast) are present on the grain boundaries and triple junctions (Figure 3.16d). In some triple junctions, the eutectic structure of the Laves phase is observed. These eutectic structures indicate melting of the Laves phase during the 1200ºC solutionizing treatment. The fracture surface of the materials after the 240 h anneal, shown in Figure 3.16h, show intergranular fracture.  This fracture mode of the material is different from the others since the grain boundaries were fully covered by Laves phase and NiAl precipitates. The elongation of this sample is less than 1 % as shown in Figure 3.14d.

3.4 Summary
            Microstructural analyses and mechanical testing of the recently developed AFA stainless steel alloy DAFA29 has been performed in both the as-received condition and after two series of thermo-mechanical treatments.  During these treatments, materials were cold rolled to a 90 % thickness reduction (both with and without a solutionizing anneal at 1200ºC) and then heat treated at 800ºC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h.
            It was found that:
1.	A solutionizing anneal at 1200ºC followed by cold rolling and annealing at 800ºC can be used to generate a finer-scale and more uniform distribution of Laves phase precipitates.
2.	The solution anneal produces a large increase in grain size from 40 to 250 μm.
3.	The alloy contain Fe2Nb Laves phase, MC carbide, Ni3Al(Ti) L12, and B2 NiAl precipitates after either thermo-mechanical treatment. 
4.	Cold rolling produces a high density of dislocations, which act as nucleation sites for Fe2Nb Laves phase, MC carbide, B2 NiAl, and Ni3Al(Ti)  precipitate formation.
5.	Nanocrystalline grains are produced after cold rolling and short time anneals, which grow rapidly to µm-scale size on subsequent annealing at 800ºC.
6.	Nanocrystalline steels processed through large strain cold rolling exhibit a dramatic increase in yield strength up to 1280 MPa.  The yield strength decreases upon further annealing due to grain growth and precipitate coarsening.
7.	The yield strength of thermo-mechanically treated AFA steels exhibits a Hall-Petch relationship with a large value for σ0 that likely arises from precipitate strengthening (σppt).






Chapter 4 The Effect of Thermo-mechanical Treatment on the High Temperature Tensile Behavior of an Alumina-forming Austenitic Steel


4.1	Introduction
             In previous chapter, two TMTs were performed on this AFA stainless steel, specifically DAFA29, in an attempt to further improve the mechanical properties. The microstructures and deformation behavior of this AFA alloy in both the as-received condition and after the TMTs were characterized at room temperature. The TMT reduced the grain size significantly to the nanoscale (~100 nm) and increased the room temperature yield strength to above 1000 MPa.
            In this chapter, the deformation behavior of this AFA alloy in both the as-received condition and after the TMTs was studied at elevated temperatures from 600ºC to 800ºC.  The flow stress of the TMT materials was evaluated at different strain rates, and the high temperature deformation mechanisms were studied.
4.2	Experimental 
4.2.1	Tensile Tests at Elevated Temperature 
            Tensile test specimens were milled to dog-bone geometry with a gauge length of 10 mm, width of 2.65 mm, thickness of 0.8 mm, and polished to a mirror finish using 800 grit silicon carbide papers followed by 0.3 μm alumina powder.
            Elevated temperature (600 ºC, 700ºC and 800ºC) tensile tests were performed with an Instron 5690 tensile testing machine and a MTS hydraulic testing machine.  A preload force of 50 N was applied before the tensile tests.  The initial strain rate for all tensile tests was 5 × 10-4 s-1. Elongations were measured directly from the gauge of the specimens after the tensile tests. All the tensile tests were performed three times for each specimen. The resulting test data are shown as true stress- true strain curves.
            The as-received DAFA29 were tensile tested at different strain rate from 5 × 10-6 to 5 × 10-2 s-1 on the Instron 5690 tensile testing machine at 700ºC.
4.2.2	Strain Rate Jump Tests at Elevated Temperature 
            Strain rate jump tests were performed on the Instron 5690 tensile testing machine at 600 ºC and 700ºC on both as-received and TMT alloys. A preload force of 50 N was again applied on specimen before the strain rate jump tests were started. The initial strain rate for all strain rate jump tests was 5 × 10-5 s-1.
4.3	Results 
4.3.1 Tensile Tests at Elevated Temperatures
            Tensile tests of TMT Method#1 alloys were performed at 700ºC. The stress strain curves of the three TMT alloys are shown in Figure 4.1a.  All three TMT alloys show lower yield strength but higher elongation compared to the as-received DAFA29, see Table 4.1.  The tensile behaviors of these TMT alloys at 700ºC are significantly different from room temperature.  They show yield strength above 1000 MPa in room temperature tensile tests [47]. 
            Tensile tests of TMT alloys Method#2 were also carried out at 700ºC. The stress strain curves of the three TMT alloys are shown in Figure 4.1b. The results are similar to the stress strain curves observed for the TMT Method#1 tests.  All the TMT alloys show lower yield strength, but higher elongation.  The yield strengths (measured as 0.2% proof stress) were in the range of 270-346 MPa, see Table 4.1.

            After the tensile tests at 700ºC, all test specimens were characterized using the SEM. All the treated samples have different shapes of the necked region because of differences in ductility.  TMT (Method#1) alloys after ageing for 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h showed reductions in area of 33 %, 64 %, and 93 %, respectively. The differences in the reduction in area are due to the different grain sizes for these three treated samples [47]. The grain sizes of TMT (Method#1) annealed for 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h samples are ~100 nm, ~270 nm, and ~1 µm, respectively [47].  Thus, the elongation and reduction in area increased with increasing grain size, presumably due to the reduction in yield strength. 
            For TMT alloys treated using Method#2, the reductions in area for the 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h samples were 49 %, 67 % and 91 %, respectively.  The microstructures of these TMT alloys were shown in our previous work in [47]. The grain size of TMT samples with ageing 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h are ~200 nm, ~450 nm, and ~2 µm, respectively.  The 240 h annealed TMT alloy also has the largest area reduction and the highest elongation up to 53 % due to the fast grain growth to larger than 2 µm during 800ºC annealing [47].
            Figure 4.2 shows fracture surfaces of as-received DAFA29, TMT 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h samples after tensile testing at 700ºC.  The fracture surface of as-received DAFA29 shows ductile failure with large ductile dimples and considerable plastic deformation between the dimples. The fracture surfaces of TMT alloys are covered with a thick layer of oxide due to exposure at high temperature during the tensile tests. However, the Laves phase precipitates, which show white contrast, are still visible.  There are no dimples evident on the fracture surface for all three TMT alloys, although the materials are all much more ductile than as-received DAFA29.  This ductility is due to the small grain sizes (ranging from ~100 nm to 1 µm) of these three TMT samples.   All three fracture surfaces are coved by a layer of oxide formed during tensile test at 700ºC




Figure 4.2 BSE images of fracture surfaces for as-received (a) and TMT DAFA29 (Method#1, b is for 2.4h, c is for 24 h and d is for 240 h) tensile tested at 700ºC annealed for the times indicated.
            As-received and TMT DAFA29 samples were also tested at elevated temperatures from 600ºC to 800ºC. The resulting true stress-strain curves are shown in Figure 4.3.  At 600ºC (Figure 4.3a), the stress strain curve of as-received DAFA29 has a yield stress of 535 MPa, shows considerable work-hardening and an ultimate tensile strength of 665 MPa at an elongation of 20 %.  The TMT alloys showed higher yield strengths of 928 and 886 MPa for Method#1 and Method#2, respectively.  At 800ºC, the yield strength of as-received DAFA29 decreased to 360 MPa with no work-hardening evident.  The yield strength of TMT alloys decreased dramatically lower to 150 (Method#1) and 120 MPa (Method#2) with elongations more than 40 %. 

Figure 4.3 True stress-strain curves for as-received and TMT DAFA29 at 600ºC (a) and 800ºC (b). All the tensile tests were performed with an initial strain rate of 5 × 10-4 s-1.
            Figure 4.4 provides a summary of the yield stress of as-received and TMT DAFA29 tested at different temperatures. The behavior of  as-received DAFA29 is similar to many f.c.c. alloys reported in the literature [3, 54], i.e.: nickel-base superalloys and nickel iron-base superalloy. The yield strength is not greatly affected by the increase in temperature until it reaches a certain temperature.  This transition temperature is 600ºC for the as-received DAFA29. The flow stress of L12 precipitates increase anomalously with increase of temperature [55]. Therefore, the temperature independence of the yield strength of AFA alloys until 600ºC is the net effect of strength reduction of f.c.c. phase compensated by the increase of strength from L12 precipitates [55].  
            The TMT AFA alloys show yield stresses significantly larger than the as-received DAFA29 at room temperature.  This is due to the fine grain size present after the TMT process for both TMT methods (100-200 nm). Details of the room temperature tensile test results were described in previous published paper [47]. As the temperature increased to 600ºC, the yield stress of the TMT alloys decreased gradually until 600ºC and then decreased dramatically at 700ºC.   This significant loss of stress in the range of 600ºC to 700ºC might be due to increased diffusion rates in TMT alloys leading to fast dislocation climb.  The large volume of grain boundaries in TMT alloys lose the function to interrupt of dislocation motion due to the fast dislocation climbing. The grain boundaries work as sites of weakness above 600ºC.
            At 800ºC, this grain boundary effect is more obvious. The yield strength of TMT alloys is less than half of the yield strength of as-received DAFA29 as shown in Figure 4.4.  At this temperature, dislocations will be able to move around obstacles easily, the grain refined TMT alloys become significantly weaker.

4.3.2 Strain Rate Jump Tests at Elevated Temperatures
            Generally, the flow stress of alloys at elevated temperature is a function of the applied strain rate. The magnitude of the effect is expressed by the strain rate sensitivity m.  Theoretically, it is possible to carry out a series tensile tests at various temperatures and strain rates.  In practice, this is rarely done because of the limitations of time and the numbers of specimens required.  Instead, strain rate jump tests can be performed using a single specimen. The strain rate is increased to a second level (approximately an order of magnitude) once a steady state flow stress is obtained. 

            Strain rate jump experiments were performed on as-received and TMT DAFA29 at 600ºC. The strain rate jump test results are shown in Figure 4.5a.  The initial strain rate was 5 × 10-5 s-1 with an order of magnitude increase for each jump. The flow stresses of both TMT alloys increased with the strain rate increases.  But, the flow stress of as-received DAFA29 is relatively independent of strain rate at this temperature.  It is insensitive to the strain rate change at 600ºC. It is worth noting the serrations that occurred on the as-received DAFA29 during testing at 600ºC.  The serrated flow starts when the strain rate jumps from 5 × 10-5 s-1 to 5 × 10-4 s-1.  It is thought to be related to dynamic strain aging in this material. We will further explain these serrations in the discussion section.
            Strain rate jump tests were also performed at 700ºC which is the target application temperature for AFA stainless steels. The results of strain rate jump tests of as-received and TMT DAFA29 performed are shown in Figure 4.5b.  The initial strain rate was 5 × 10-5 s-1 with an order of magnitude increase for each jump. The flow stresses of all samples increased with the strain rate increasing.   At the strain rate of 5 × 10-5 s-1, the flow stress of as-received DAFA29 was 445 MPa which is almost twice that of TMT DAFA29 of 292 MPa.  When the strain rate is jumped to 5 × 10-2 s-1, the flow stress of as-received DAFA29 was 829 MPa, which is less than that of TMT DAFA29 of 1080 MPa. 

Figure 4.5 Strain rate jump tests of as-received and TMT DAFA29 (Method#1 and Method#2) at 600ºC (a) and 700ºC (b).  Each strain rate jump is increased by an order of magnitude starting at an initial strain rate of 5 × 10-5 s-1.
4.3.3 Strain Rate Influence on Microstructures
            In order to understand the fracture behavior of as-received DAFA29 at different strain rates, tensile tests of as-received DAFA29 alloys were performed at 700ºC for selected strain rates (5 × 10-6 s-1, 5 × 10-4 s-1, and 5 × 10-2 s-1). The resulting true stress-strain curves are shown in Figure 4.6. The flow stresses are comparable to the results from the strain rate jump test results shown in Figure 4.5. Both the yield strength and work-hardening rate increase with increasing strain rate.  A summary of the yield strengths and work-hardening rates is shown in Table 4.2.

            TEM observations were used in order to investigate the dislocation distributions at 700ºC.  Figure 4.7 shows bright field (BF) TEM images for the samples tested at different strain rates.  The sample (Figure 4.7a) tested at 5 × 10-2 s-1 has the highest dislocation density compared to the other two samples.  The high dislocation density in Figure 4.7a effectively enhanced the dislocation interactions which created additional barriers in the lattice for slip. These barriers produced the high work hardening rate observed at this strain rate (Figure 4.6).  For the lower strain rates, the dislocation density was also lower.  The samples tested at both 5 × 10-4 and 5 × 10-6 s-1 show no work hardening and lower dislocation densities. The dislocations in Figure 4.7a are observed to align along one direction. This might be due to the high strain rate during the tensile test.
            In Figure 4.7c, Fe2Nb Laves phase and NiAl precipitates are present. These precipitates are located on grain boundaries and they are generated during the low strain rate test.  Small (~26 nm) spherical L12-Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates are also uniformly distributed in the f.c.c. matrix. The dislocations show strong interactions with these L12 precipitates. Numerous dislocation loops around L12 precipitates are present.  The pinning effects of the precipitates result in the observed wavy dislocations.  On the grain boundaries, numerous dislocations are crowded around the Fe2Nb Laves phase suggesting that the Laves phase precipitates are very strong obstacles to dislocation motion.

            In the sample tested at strain rate of 5 × 10-6 s-1, multiple slip features were observed in the grain boundary Laves phase precipitates. These slip features are speculated to be formed during the high temperature tensile tests at this slow strain rate.  The slip bands are ~100 nm wide, see Figure 4.8a.  All these slip features are aligned along &lt;10-10&gt;.  Figure 4.8b shows a select area diffraction pattern from this precipitate. The zone axis is [11-20]. These slip features are expected to be on the basal planes [56]. In order to confirm this, the Laves phase precipitate was characterized at different diffraction conditions. 
            Figure 4.8c, d and e show BF TEM images of the Laves phase precipitate observed at different zone axis. When viewed along both [11-20] and [1-100] the slip features are observed as lines, see Figure 4.8c and 4.8d, Viewing along the [10-11] (Figure 12e), those features became slip bands. By orienting these features corresponding to the [11-20] zone axis based on SAD patterns, we confirm these stacking faults are on the basal planes of the Laves phase. The fringes in both Figure 4.8c and d are the edge on of these parallel planer features. The white arrows in Figure 4.8e shows one of these features with a partial dislocation at the end of one or multiple stacking faults.  This is similar to previous observation of stacking faults and bounding dislocations in other C14 structures such as Cr-Ta and Cr-Nb system [56, 57], Cr-Ti and Cr-Hf system [56, 58]

4.4	Discussion
            At 700ºC, the yield strength of as-received DAFA29 is 523 MPa and it is slightly lower than its room temperature yield strength 560MPa [47]. It work-hardens significantly with an elongation of 20 % at room temperature, while it shows low work-hardening rate at 700ºC with an elongation of 28 %.  
            The TMT alloys show lower yield strength (~390 MPa) but higher elongation compared to the as-received DAFA29, see Figure 1 and 4.  It is evident that the TMTs which result in a fine grain size significantly improve the room temperature properties, but this grain size strengthening is negligible at 700ºC.  In room temperature, assuming off-set stress σ0 is constant for all TMT alloys, the estimate grain size strengthening effect is ~600 MPa according to the △σ = KD-1/2 [47, 59]. 
            As the temperature increased to 700ºC, the grain boundary strengthening effect became negligible due to the weakness of the grain boundaries. The high volume of grain boundaries in the TMT alloys are unable to block the motion of dislocations. For the 2.4 h annealed samples, the TMT Method#1 alloy still showed higher strength than TMT Method#2 alloy at 700ºC although it has more grain boundaries (smaller grain size).  This is mainly because the high temperature strength of TMT alloys has a strengthening contribution from the small Laves phase precipitates as well as the grain boundaries. The Laves phase precipitates in TMT Method#1 alloys are in the range of 167 ± 37 nm which is slightly smaller than it is in TMT Method#2 alloys (175 ± 45 nm) [47]. 
            For all the annealed specimens, the 2.4 h and 24 h annealed TMT method#1 alloys shows higher yield strength compared to TMT Method#2 alloys due to a smaller grain size. When the annealing time was increased to 240 h, TMT Method#2 alloys have higher strength than TMT Method#2. This might be due to an increase in the volume fraction of the Laves phase during the long time aging process. After 240 h aging, the large Laves phase precipitates in TMT Method#2 alloys are not present.  Instead smaller Laves phase are precipitated out with size of ~560 nm [47]. In TMT Method#1 alloys, there are still large Laves phase precipitate present in the microstructure
            The following section will discuss the strain rate sensitivity of the as-received and TMT DAFA29. The deformation mechanism at elevated temperature will also be discussed based on the flow stress and strain rate for each alloy. Table 4.3 summarizes the flow stress at different strain rates for the as-received and TMT DAFA29 alloys.

* The flow stress is the peak stress at each strain rate and temperature for all the alloys.
            At 600ºC, which is &lt;0.5Tm (Tm is 1365ºC for as-received DAFA29), the L12 precipitates in the as-received DAFA29 are fine (~10 nm) due to the slow coarsening rate at this temperature. There is a strong dislocations cutting of forest dislocations and dislocation shearing of precipitates. This dislocation cutting and shearing results in a stress independent of the strain rate with a low strain rate sensitivity of 0.02.  As the grain size decreases into the nano-size range for the TMT alloys, the rate-limiting process is increasingly influenced by the interactions of grain boundaries with dislocations, due to thermally activated dislocation annihilation at grain boundaries [60]. This results in a larger strain rate sensitivity for all TMT alloys even at 600ºC.
            At 700°C (&gt;0.5Tm), the L12 precipitates coarsened to a larger size (~30 nm) during the slow strain rate testing process. The dominant mechanism changed to dislocation looping and dislocation precipitate interaction stress decreased due to L12 coarsening. At this temperature, the work hardening is negligible. The reduction of work hardening in DAFA29 is due to a softening mechanism such as dynamic recovery which is prominent at elevated temperature [61]. This lower strengthening effect and loss of work hardening resulted in higher strain rate sensitivity m of 0.12. The precipitate coarsening during the strain rate jump testing affects the f low stress behavior.
4.4.1 Strain Rate Sensitivity
The flow stress and strain rate are typically related at a constant elevated temperature by the following equation:
                                                          (4.1)
where C is a constant,  is the flow stress, is the strain rate, and m is the strain rate sensitivity parameter.
            Based on the flow stress results shown in Table 4.3, the flow stress is plotted as a function of strain rate on a log-log scale in Figure 4.9. The strain rate sensitivity m can be obtained from 
                                                            (4.2)
            The m value can be obtained based on a linear fit as shown in Figure 4.9. m of as-received DAFA29 is 0.12, while the values for TMT DAFA29 is 0.18 (Method#1) and 0.19 (Method#2), i.e. the yield stresses of the TMT DAFA29 alloys are more sensitive to strain rate compared to the as-received DAFA29 at 700ºC. The slight difference in m values for TMT Method#1 and Method#2 is probably due to different grain sizes [47].  At 600ºC m for as-received DAFA29 is 0.02, whereas the m values for the TMT AFA alloys are 0.08 (Method#1) and 0.09 (Method#2).  All the m values obtained at 600ºC are much smaller than those obtained at 700ºC, indicating that the strain rate sensitivity is influenced by the temperature for all tested alloys.
            At both 600ºC and 700ºC, the alloys treated by Method#2 with a grain size of ~200 nm have a slightly higher m than alloys treated by Method#1. Alloys treated by Method#1 have a grain size of ~100 nm which is about half size of alloys treated by Method#2.  It shows an increase in strain rate sensitivity with decreasing grain size.  This trend has also been observed in other nanocrystalline alloys [62, 63].
            At the same testing temperature, the strain rate sensitivity is larger for the smaller nano-sized grains in the TMT alloys compared to coarse grains of ~40 µm for the as-received DAFA29. A number of models [62, 64, 65] indicate the grain size dependence of the strain rate sensitivity is related to a decrease in the activation volume V.

Figure 4.9 Flow stress as a function of strain on log-log scale plots from data obtained for alloys tested at (a) 600°C and (b) 700°C.
            The strain rate sensitivity m can also be expressed as [63, 64, 66]:
                                                      (4.3)
where k, T, V and σ are Boltzman constant, absolute temperature, activation volume and yield/flow stress, respectively. 
           The activation volume V is broadly defined as the rate of decrease of activation enthalpy with respect to the flow stress at a fixed temperature. It influences the rate-controlling mechanisms in the plastic deformation of engineering metals and alloys [63]. Based on analysis of the activation volume, one may suggest a hypothesis about the controlling deformation mechanisms in the TMT alloys. The value of V is some two orders of magnitude smaller for nanocrystalline metals than for microcrystalline metals [63]. 
            The activation volume V can be calculated based on equations 4.2 and 4.3. A plot of log ()/log (σ) as function of σ has a slope of V/ and activation volumes can be obtained based on the value of the slope.  The activation volume for metals is normally expressed in terms of b3, where b is the shortest burgers vector of a perfect dislocation. In f.c.c. iron the burgers vector is 0.253 nm [67]. The calculated activation volumes for DAFA29 at 700ºC is 1.1 b3 (65 b3 at 600 ºC), while the values for the TMT alloys are 0.7 b3 (Method#1) and 0.8 b3 (Method#2), respectively. The activation volume for the fine grained TMT alloys is smaller than that of the coarse-grained alloys. Dislocations have a higher activation barrier when the grain size enters the nanometer regime. This is similar to other alloys tested at both room temperature and elevated temperature [60, 67, 68]. The mechanisms related with low activation volumes in nano grain materials are thought to be associated with thermally activated diffusion processes at the grain boundaries [69]. 
4.4.2 Deformation Mechanisms
            The relationship between strain rate and stress of the precipitation-strengthened alloys at elevated temperature can be described by a power law [17, 70, 71]:
                                                          (4.4)
where G is the shear modulus (MPa), b is the Burgers vector (nm), D is the diffusion coefficient of the f.c.c. matrix (m2/s), k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature (K), and n is the stress exponent. A stress exponent n in the range of 3-5 is typical for solid solution alloys.  Specifically, n is 5 for nickel and nickel-chromium alloys [58, 70, 72].  For precipitate-strengthened alloys, the n values obtained are normally larger than the solid solution alloys [71]. The high stress exponent arising from small dispersed precipitates being obstacles to the movement of dislocations [73, 74].
            In order to reduce the high stress exponent values, a threshold stress term σt is introduced into equation 4.4 to account for the influence of the precipitates. The effective stress is defined as σ - σt. Thus, equation 4.4 can be rewritten as:
                                                       (4.5)
            The value of the threshold stress σt depends on the dislocation precipitate interaction mechanism.  The mechanism could be dislocation cutting, Orowan looping, or dislocation climb. This value can be determined using the methodology suggested by Lagneborg and Bergman [75].  Basically, equation 4.5 can be rewritten:
                                                       (4.6)
            The threshold stress σt can be obtained from a plot of  as a function of σ, as shown in Figure 4.10 and the threshold stress is the x-intercept. The threshold stress obtained using this method is 217 MPa for as-received DAFA29 at 700ºC, which is similar to the threshold stress value measured in another AFA alloy tested at the same temperature [17].  The threshold stresses are 50 MPa (Method#1) and 9 MPa (Method#2) for the TMT alloys tested at 700ºC.  These values increase to 670 MPa (Method#1) and 574 MPa (Method#2) for the TMT alloys tested at 600ºC.  Table 4.4 provides a summary of threshold stresses for the different processing conditions.  The threshold stress of alloys treated by Method#1 is slightly larger than that of Method#2 for both temperatures. The value of the threshold stress decreased significantly with an increase in temperature, and is almost zero for alloys treated by Method#2 at higher temperature.

            Figure 4.11 shows a plot of strain rate as a function of effective stress (σ - σt) for the as-received and TMT DAFA29 alloys. The corrected n value is 4.2 for the as-received DAFA29 tested at 700ºC which is close to the stress exponent value of another AFA alloy reported in [17].  At 600ºC, the n values of treated alloys decrease to 4.9 and 5.0 which are typical of n values for solid solution alloys [76]. 

Figure 4.11 Strain rate as a function of the effective stress (σ - σt) for as-received and TMT DAFA29 alloys. The plots are on log-log scales.
            The extrapolated threshold stresses of the treated alloys at 600ºC are much higher than those obtained at 700ºC. They decrease significantly with the increase in temperature of 100ºC. Three possible mechanisms are considered to explain the threshold stress in precipitation-strengthened alloys: 1) precipitate cutting,  2) Orowan dislocation bowing, 3) dislocation climbing [76] . 
            The Orowan dislocation bowing stress for dislocation interact with Ni3(Al,Ti) particles is 
                                                                (4.7)   
where τo  is the shear stress necessary for precipitates bypass by Orowan bowing,  L is particle spacing, r is the radius of precipitates.  
            At 700ºC, the average size of Ni3(Al, Ti) precipitates is 35 nm after an 800ºC anneal for 2.4 h.  The particle spacing obtained based on L and the volume fraction is 140 nm [47]. The volume fraction of L12 phase can be calculated based on density and phase fraction from a JMatPro simulation shown in Figure 4.12.  G is approximately 50 GPa for AFA alloys and b is estimate to be 0.253 nm.  The calculated Orowan shear stress is about 180 MPa for both TMT AFA alloys.  The threshold stress values of TMT alloys are about 0.3τo (50 MPa for Method#1) and 0.05τo (9 MPa for Method#2).  These values are similar to those obtained from the Arzt-Ashby model for the local climb and general climb mechanisms [77].  For as-received DAFA29, the calculated Orowan shear stress is about 212 MPa with a particle spacing of 120 nm and average particle size of 30 nm. This Orowan stress is consistent with the threshold stresses of as-received DAFA29, which is 217 MPa. 
            At 600ºC, the threshold stress values are much higher than Orowan shear stress for both TMT alloys. This might be due to a change to a precipitate shearing mechanism and a higher volume fraction of Ni3(Al,Ti) at this temperature (Figure 4.12).

Figure 4.12 Phase fractions of different phases in DAFA29 alloys from a JMatPro simulation
             The activation energy (Q) can be determined by assuming that strain rate follows an Arrhenius type relationship [70, 78]:
                                                   (4.8)
where A is a constant, R is the gas constant and n is the stress exponent. This equation can be converted to the following equation [78]. 
                                        (4.9)
The activation energy under a constant strain rate can be calculated based on the above equation.  Q/(R·n) is the slope of lnσ plotted as a function of 1/T.  Figure 4.13 shows the plot of lnσ as a function of 1/T for as-received DAFA29 and TMT alloys at strain rate of 5 × 10-5 s-1. Based on the calculation, the activation energy for as-received DAFA29 is 124 kJ/mol. The activation energies of the TMT alloys are 409 kJ/mol for Method#1 and 491 kJ/mol for Method#2, respectively. The activation energy of as-received DAFA29 is similar to other AFA alloys studied by Zhou et al. [17].  The activation energy is slightly larger than other AFA alloys and austenite steels. But this high activation energy is also found in other superalloys such as alloy 617 [70] and IN 718 [79]. Such large values of activation energy can be reduced to 248–251 kJ/mol when considering the effective stress instead of the applied stress [80].

4.4.3 Dynamic Strain Aging of DAFA29
            At 600ºC, the yield stress of as-received DAFA29 is insensitive to the strain rate, as shown in Figure 4.5a.   The flow stress curve shows evidence of negative strain rate sensitivity with significant serrated flow.  This serrated flow starts when the strain rate jumps from 5 × 10-5 to 5 × 10-4 s-1.  This phenomenon is also observed for other stainless steels and high temperature superalloys [61, 81-84].  The serrated flow is expected to be associated with dynamic strain aging (DSA) which occurs at certain combinations of temperature and strain rate [81, 84].  The occurrence of DSA is the result of solute diffusion in the metal lattice during plastic deformation at certain temperatures.  The accumulation of these solute elements can impede the movement of dislocations and results in serrated flow curves.  The solute elements typically responsible for this behavior are carbon below 550ºC, and Cr or Mo at temperatures above 550ºC [84, 85].
4.4.4 DAFA29 is Insensitive to Strain Rate at 600ºC
            The yield stress of DAFA29 is not dependent on the strain rate at 600ºC.  This might be related to the work hardening of DAFA29 at this temperature.  At 700ºC or higher, there is little work hardening for DAFA29 as shown in Figure 4.1 and 4.3.  The reduction of work hardening in as-received DAFA29 at temperature of  700ºC and higher temperature is due to a softening mechanism such as dynamic recovery which is expected to become the dominant mechanism at elevated temperature [61]. At higher temperatures, the work hardening due to the increase in dislocation density with increasing strain is counteracted by the formation of subgrains with low energy dislocations. Thermally-activated climb of dislocations is the prominent dynamic recovery mechanism for precipitate-strengthened alloys. This will overcome the obstacles of dislocation motion which is restrained at the lower temperature of 600ºC. This is also influenced by strain rate during tensile tests since the recovery is diffusion controlled process  [61]. 
4.5	Conclusions
            In this chapter, the recently-developed AFA alloy, DAFA29, was treated by two TMT methods.  The resulting fine-grained alloys were tensile tested at elevated temperatures.  Their mechanical properties were also evaluated by strain rate jump tests at two different temperatures.  These results were compared to data for the as-received AFA alloy. The findings of this research are summarized as follows:
1.	The TMT didn’t increase the yield strengths of AFA alloys at 700ºC, although it significantly enhanced the yield strength of AFA alloys at room temperature.
2.	The TMT AFA alloys have higher strain rate sensitivity and lower activation volume compared to as-received DAFA29 at elevated temperatures. The higher strain rate sensitivity and lower activation volume are due to the nanocrystalline grain size of the alloys. 
3.	For the two TMT AFA alloys, the strain rate and stress satisfy a power law relationship with the stress exponent around 5, whereas the stress exponent is around 4 for the as-received DAFA29. These values ruled out the mechanisms of bulk diffusion (Nabarro-Herring mechanism) and grain boundary diffusion (Coble mechanism) to explain the flow behavior.
4.	At 700ºC, dislocation climb is the dominant mechanism for deformation of TMT alloys. When the temperature decrease to 600ºC, the mechanism changes to dislocation shearing as indicated by the dramatically increased threshold stress. 
5.	The yield stress of TMT alloys decrease rapidly from 600ºC to 700ºC, which might be because increased diffusion rates in TMT alloys lead to fast dislocation climb at 700ºC. At this temperature, dislocation will be able to move around obstacles easily and the large volume of grain boundaries in TMT alloys work as sites of weakness.
6.	The flow stress of the as-received AFA alloy is insensitive to strain rate at 600ºC due to strong work hardening at this temperature. It also shows significant serrated flow on the stress strain curve, which is associated with dynamic strain aging effect.





















Chapter 5 Characterization of the Aging of Alumina-forming Austenitic Alloys


5.1	Introduction
            The current chapter investigates the effects of aging on the microstructures and mechanical properties of the recently-developed AFA stainless steels, DAFA26 and DAFA29, which are Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-3Al-2Ti-based alloys. We explored the effects of aging time on the microstructures of alloys, specifically on the precipitation of Fe2Nb Laves phase and B2-NiAl on the grain boundaries and L12 in f.c.c. matrix, in an attempt to further improve the mechanical properties of AFA stainless steels. The effects of boron and carbon additions on the microstructures and various precipitates are discussed.
5.2	Experimental
          The materials used for these studies were as-received DAFA26 and DAFA29. The compositions and fabrication of these two AFA alloys were described in Chapter 2. The difference between the recently-developed alumina-forming austenitic alloys DAFA26 and DAFA29 is the carbon and boron content: DAFA29 has 0.1 wt.% of carbon and 0.01 wt.% of boron, whereas DAFA26 has neither. Both of the alloys were annealed at 800°C for 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h. The microstructural characterization and mechanical testing methods were presented in Chapter 2. 
            Twin density, defined as the number of twin boundary intercepts per unit length, was calculated using [86, 87]:

where Ltb is the total length of twin boundaries and S is the corresponding surface area of grains. 
            The coverage of precipitation in grain boundary was measured quantitatively by using equation 5.2 [45, 46].

where ρ is the area fraction of the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates in the grain boundaries,  l and n are the lengths of the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates, respectively , and L is the length of the grain boundaries on 2-D sections. Measurements were performed on 10 BSE images of mechanically polished samples with a total grain boundary length of about 1 mm.
5.3	Results
5.3.1 Microstructures
            Figure 5.1a and b shows the microstructures of as-received DAFA26 and DAFA29, respectively. The grain size of DAFA26 is ~30 µm while that of DAFA29 is ~40 µm.  The white contrast precipitates in DAFA26 are Laves phase. All the Laves phase precipitates in DAFA26 are aligned in the hot rolling direction and have an elongated shape. No other precipitates were observed in DAFA26. The white contrast precipitates in DAFA29 are both Laves phase and MC carbides. The MC carbides normally have blocky shape with sharp-edged geometry, while the Laves phase precipitates have a elongated granular shape due to hot rolling process. These two precipitates can also be differentiated based on EDS results: EDS spectra of Laves phase and MC carbides in DAFA29 are shown in Figure 5.1c and d. 
            Twins were also observed in many grains in as-received DAFA26. The calculated twin boundary density in DAFA26 is 22 ± 4 /mm (28 twin boundaries counted).  Almost no twin boundaries were observed in as-received DAF29.



Figure 5.1 BSE images of as-received DAFA26 (a) and DAFA29 (b). (c) and (d) are EDS spectra of the Laves phase and MC carbide precipitates in (b). No MC carbides are present in DAFA26.
            The microstructures of DAFA26 and DAFA29 are shown in Figure 5.2 after aging for 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h at 800°C.  There is no obvious grain growth for either DAFA26 or DAFA29 after these aging times. Twins were still observed in 240 h-aged DAFA26, but the twin boundary density was reduced to 16 ± 3 /mm (32 twin boundaries counted). Again, no twins were observed in aged DAFA29. The morphology and size of Laves phase (bright contrast) precipitates in DAFA26 didn’t change during the aging process. The MC carbides still have the blocky shape with sharp-edged geometry. The average size of MC carbides also didn’t increase after 240 h aging. 
            As the aging time was increased, more and more grain boundary precipitates are observed in both DAFA26 and DAFA29. This is particularly evident for the alloys aged for 240 h as shown in Figure 5.2e and f. The grain boundary in DAFA29 is almost fully covered with these precipitates.  
            The small needle shape precipitates (indicated by yellow arrows) in the f.c.c. matrix of 240 h-aged DAFA26 and DAFA29 are co-precipitates of Laves phase and B2-NiAl phase based on EDS analysis. They formed randomly inside matrix after 240 h aging.

            Figure 5.3 shows high magnification BSE images of the grain boundary precipitates after aging at 800°C for different times. Figure 5.3a, c and e show BSE images of aged DAFA26 after aging times of 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h. As the aging time increases, more Laves phase (bright contrast) and B2-NiAl (dark contrast) precipitates are formed on grain boundaries. The two precipitates are also identified by EDS in SEM. For the sample aged for 240 h, the grain boundaries are largely covered with the precipitates of Laves and B2-NiAl phase.  The grain boundary coverage for this sample is 83 % according the calculation method described in experimental section. 
            Similar phenomena were also observed for DAFA29 as shown in Figure 5.3b, d, and f.  As the aging time increase, more and more Laves phase, B2-NiAl precipitates are formed on the grain boundaries. No small MC carbides are observed on grain boundaries based on EDS analysis in SEM. As the aging time increased to 240 h, Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates are densely packed in the grain boundaries in 240 h-aged DAFA29.  The grain boundary precipitate coverage is 94 % according to the same method we used for DAFA26.  The grain boundary precipitate in 240 h-aged DAFA29 has higher coverage than it is in DAFA26.

            In order to further determine the size of Laves phase precipitates and B2-NiAl in grain boundaries of 240 h-aged DAFA26 and DAFA29, samples were mechanical polished and characterized in SEM. BSE images of grain boundaries of 240 h-aged DAFA26 and DAFA29 are shown in Figure 5.4a and b. The lighter contrast particles in the grain boundaries are the Laves phase and the darker contrast particles in the grain boundaries are the B2-NiAl precipitates. 
            A statistical analysis was performed to characterize the size and size distribution of the Laves phase and B2-NiAl in the grain boundaries. The size distribution histograms of the Laves phase particles are shown in Figure 5.4c and d for 240 h-aged DAFA26 and DAFA29, respectively. The average size (defined as equivalent diameter sphere) of Laves phase is 326 ± 64 nm in DAFA26 which is 11 % larger than in DAFA29 (294 ± 57 nm).  The histograms of the B2-NiAl are shown in Figure 5.4e and f for 240 h-aged DAFA26 and DAFA29. The average size is 363 ± 152 nm in DAFA26, while it is 304 ± 114 nm in DAFA29.

(N stands for the number of particles counted and ± means the standard deviation of the particle size.)

           The coarsening behavior of the L12 phase present in the matrix was investigated using the SEM. Figure 5.5 shows SE images of the spherical L12 particles in all the aged alloys. The morphology of L12 particles is still spherical after 240 h aging at 800ºC. As the aging time increases from 2.4h to 240h, the L12 phase had obviously grow.  Based on statistical analysis, the particle size (average diameter) of L12 particles in DAFA26 increases from 36 ± 4 nm to 124 ± 30 nm after aging for 240 h, while the L12 particles in DAFA29 grow from 35 ± 7 nm to 124 ± 28 nm. Histograms of the L12 particle size in DAFA26 and DAFA29 at each aging time are shown in Figure 5.6.  The sizes of L12 particles are similar in both DAFA26 and DAFA29 for each aging time. The additions of boron and carbon in DAFA29 have no evident influence on the size and morphology of L12 particles. The size and stable shape of L12 is beneficial to the mechanical properties of AFA alloys during long time service at high temperature.

            In order to study the lattice parameters in the two alloys, synchrotron XRD experiments were performed on the aged samples of these two alloys. 
            Figure 5.7 shows synchrotron XRD results of aged DAFA26 and aged DAFA29.  Both alloys show large characteristic peaks, such as 111, 002 and 022, which arise from both the L12 particles and f.c.c. matrix since the lattice constants of these two phases are very close to each other. The changes of peak intensity between different specimens likely arises not from differences in texture but because the X-ray slit size used was only 100 µm ×100 µm and, thus, the X-ray peaks includes information from only ~10 grains).  The small peaks observed in both DAFA26 and DAFA29 are from the L12, B2-NiAl, and Laves phase precipitates.
            X-ray peaks from the L12, B2-NiAl, and Laves phase can be more clearly identified in the small angle region (2 range from 9-18o) for all the aged samples as shown in Figure 5.7c and d.  No peaks from MC carbides were observed in any aged DAFA29 samples. This is likely because of the low volume fraction of this phase (much less than 1 wt.% based on JMatPro simulation). The peak height of the Laves phase in aged DAFA29 is much lower than that in aged DAFA26, while the peak height of the L12 phase is similar for both alloys. This result is consistent with our previous SEM observations of the volume fractions of the Laves phase and L12 precipitates. A peak from B2-NiAl phase is not clearly evident until after 240 h aging. This indicates most of B2-NiAl precipitates were formed during 24 h to 240 h aging.
            The calculated lattice parameters of each phase at each aging time are shown in Table 5.1. The lattice misfit between the f.c.c and L12 phases is less than 0.2 % for all the aged AFA alloys. The lattice parameters of B2-NiAl in aged DAFA29 appear to increase with increased annealing time. However, it is worth noting that determination of lattice parameters from low angle peaks is not very accurate. 
There are no differences in the lattice parameters of the various phases in DAFA 26 compared to DAFA 29 except, possibly, for the f.c.c. matrix, which is larger in DAFA29.  This suggests that the boron in DAFA29 may also reside in the matrix.

            Figure 5.8 shows BSE and TEM images of discontinuous precipitation (or cellular growth) of the B2-NiAl phase in 2.4 h-aged DAFA26. Discontinuous precipitation was found in DAFA26 annealed for both 2.4 h and 24 h, but not for 240 h.  The precipitation was found to be common throughout all the grain boundaries for short time aged DAFA26 (2.4 h and 24 h) microstructures examined. No preferred boundary misorientation for precipitation was found.  It has large influence on the grain boundary morphology as shown in Figure 5.8a. TEM EDS results are shown in Figure 5.8c. These precipitates are rich of Ni, Fe, Cr and Al.  This discontinuous precipitation was not found in any aged DAFA29 alloys based on SEM and TEM observations.

          Figure 5.9 shows the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates in a grain boundary of 240 h-aged DAFA29. EDS spectra of the three grain boundary precipitates are shown in Figure 5.9b, c and d. A small peak of boron is detected in the EDS spectrum for the Laves phase precipitate and the peak is located at 0.18 keV. No boron peak was detected in the two EDS spectra from the B2-NiAl precipitates.  In the EDS from the f.c.c. matrix, a carbon peak was detected at 0.28 keV. No carbon peak was found in the grain boundary precipitates. 
            Precipitate free zones (PFZ), with a width of 200 nm, are clearly observed around the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates. This zone connects grain boundary precipitates and f.c.c. matrix.  It lacks the precipitate strengthening from L12 precipitates compared to the f.c.c. matrix. EDS results from PFZ and f.c.c. matrix are shown in Figure 5.9e and f. These results show the microchemistry of the PFZ is mainly composed of Fe, Ni and Cr, while the f.c.c. matrix is composed of Fe, Ni, and Al. The f.c.c. matrix has more Ni, Al and Ti than the PFZ. This is because of the spherical L12-Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates present in the f.c.c. matrix. There are almost no L12-Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates observed in the PFZ. 




Figure 5.9 (a) BF TEM image, (b), (c) and (d) are EDS results of grain boundary precipitates in a grain boundary in DAFA29; (e) and (f) are the EDS results from the PFZ and the f.c.c. matrix. 
5.3.2 Mechanical Properties
            Tensile testing of the aged DAFA26 and DAFA29 was carried out at 700ºC at an initial strain rate of 5 × 10-4 s-1. The resulting stress-strain curves are shown in Figure 5.10.  Both AFA alloys show much higher yield strength after 2.4 h aging compared to the as-received alloys. Among all the aged samples, the maximum strength was achieved after aging for 2.4 h. The yield strength decreased after aging for longer times. 
            For DAFA26, as the annealing time increased from 2.4 h to 240 h, the yield strength decreased from 700 MPa to 485 MPa. The yield strength of 2.4 h aged DAFA26 is similar to 24 h aged DAFA26. As the annealing time increased from 2.4 h to 240 h, the yield strength of DAFA29 decreased from 731 MPa to 514 MPa after 240 h aging.  The yield strength of DAFA29 decreased gradually upon annealing for longer times. The elongation of all aged DAFA9 only changed slightly, while the elongation for aged DAFA29 increased with aging time. A summary of yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation for aged DAFA26 and DAFA29 is shown in Table 5.2.

            Figure 5.11 shows the fracture surfaces for 240 h-aged DAFA26 and DAFA29, respectively.  Both of the fracture surfaces shows dimples feature. This indicates the fracture modes for both aged alloys are ductile failure.

5.4	Discussion
5.4.1 Precipitates
           The morphology and sizes of L12 precipitates in all the aged DAFA26 and DAFA29 are similar at the same aging times based on SEM, TEM and statistical analysis, i.e. the L12 precipitates shows the same coarsening behavior during aging from 2.4 h to 240 h for both alloys. The addition of boron and carbon has no significant effects on the lattice parameter, morphology and size of L12 precipitates in the AFA alloys. After 240 h aging, the morphology of L12 is still spherical due to the low lattice misfit (~0.2 %) between f.c.c matrix and L12 phase. A similar result has also been observed in other f.c.c. alloy systems. Wang et al. [88] investigated the effect of boron addition on the coarsening of γ’ phase in Ni-Fe based superalloy. The results indicated adding boron having no obvious influence on γ’ coarsening behavior. 
            The average diameter (d) of the L12 precipitates is plotted against the aging time as shown in Figure 5.12. The L12 size increases as aging time increased for both aged DAFA26 and DAFA29. There is a linear relationship between dt3 - d03 and t, where d0 is the average diameter of the L12 phase in the as-received alloys (~10 nm). This linear relationship suggests coarsening of the L12 precipitates follows the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) model (dt3 ∝ t). Although the LSW model is strictly applicable when the precipitate volume fraction is very small, the cubic growth kinetics of the L12 particles has been observed in many superalloys [88-90]. The LSW model predicts time dependent coarsening behavior of the L12 particles by the following equations [89]:
 (5.3)
                                                   (5.4)
where t is the aging time, dt is the L12 particle size at the time of t, k is the coarsening rate which depends on several parameters, γ is the interfacial energy between the precipitate and f.c.c. matrix, Vm is the molar volume fraction of L12 precipitates, D is the diffusion coefficient of the solute, Cm is the atomic fraction of solute in equilibrium with the precipitate, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The coarsening rate of the L12 particles in aged DAFA26 is similar to that of DAFA29 which suggests the coarsening kinetics of the L12 phase in both DAFA26 and DAFA29 are similar and follow the LSW model.

Figure 5.12 A plot of L12 size versus aging time for both DAFA26 and DAFA29
            The grain boundary precipitates (Laves phase and B2-NiAl) also coarsened during the aging from 2.4 h to 240 h. It seems the coarsening rate of the grain boundary precipitates in aged DAFA26 and DAFA29 is slightly different. In 240 h-aged DAFA29, the grain boundary has 10% more precipitate coverage than that in DAFA26 according our measurements. The average particle size of both Laves phase and B2-NiAl in 240 h-aged DAFA29 is smaller than it is in DAFA26 based on statistic analysis. This indicates that boron in DAFA29 influences the distribution and inhibits the coarsening of the grain boundary precipitates.  That boron suppress the coarsening of grain boundary precipitates was also observed in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at.%) alloy [91, 92], Ni-Fe alloy [88, 93], and Nickel based superalloy (617B) [94]. 
            The blocky MC carbides and Laves phase in the matrix of DAFA29 were very stable during the aging process, i.e. there was no significant change of size and morphology observed after 240 h annealing.
5.4.2 Discontinuous Precipitation
            Discontinuous precipitation (or cellular growth) was found in the 2.4h and 24h aged DAFA26 specimen. BSE and BF TEM images in Figure 5.9 revealed colonies of aligned lamellar precipitates at the grain boundaries.  The precipitation reaction also influenced the morphology of grain boundaries, such that the latter appeared serrated or distorted.  The curvature of the grain boundaries was observed to curve back into the grain. This discontinuous precipitation has also been observed in a Fe-Ni-Cr-Nb (4.85 wt.% Nb) alloy [95] and [96], in another austenitic steel containing Nb [97]. It was also found recently in the nickel-based superalloy 718Plus [98].   Pickering et al. [98] discussed the mechanism for this discontinuous precipitation. It is driven by an overall reduction in free energy of the alloy system and is enabled by fast solute partitioning along the moving boundary [98]. This cellular phase is beneficial to prevent grain growth during aging and could improve the resistance to inter-granular fracture by pinning the grain boundaries. 
            No discontinuous precipitation was observed in DAFA29.  The boron and carbon additions in DAFA29 presumably suppress the discontinuous precipitation.  This suppression of discontinuous precipitate by boron has also been found in other alloys systems such as Cu-Ti alloys [99] and Ni-Fe alloys [88, 100]. This is possibly because diffusion of elements in grain boundaries was diminished by boron or the mobility of the transformation in front of the grain boundaries was reduced probably owing to pinning effect of boron segregates or other precipitates.
5.4.3 Precipitate Free Zone
          Precipitate free zones (PFZs) are also observed in aged DAFA29 between the grain boundary precipitates and the f.c.c. matrix. This zone can help to relieve stress concentrations on grain boundary precipitates. However, if the zone is too ductile or too wide, it may create large strain concentrations in grain boundary, resulting in enhanced grain boundary shear which may again lead to premature failure [101]. Baither et al. [102, 103] studied PFZ in polycrystalline γ’ strengthened nickel-based superalloy Nimonic PE16 using in-situ TEM. They confirmed that the PFZ will lower the yield strength only when PFZ’s width exceeds 1.7(L-r), where L is interparticle spacing and r is radius of the L12 particles. Beyond this width, dislocations are generated in PFZ and resulting dislocation pileups lead to the reduction of yield strength. For 240 h-aged DAFA29, the L12 volume fraction is 15.4 % and the average precipitate radius 62 nm. The calculated interparticle spacing L is around 228 nm based on following equation [38]:
                                                      (5.5)
where f is the volume fraction of L12 phase. The value of 1.7(L-r) is 278 nm, which is slightly larger than the width of PFZ in 240 h-aged DAFA29 (200 nm). Thus, according to Baither et al.’s analysis [102, 103], the PFZs in the 240 h-aged DAFA alloys are too narrow to produce softening.
5.4.4 Twinning
            Twins were observed in both as-received and annealed DAFA26, but not in DAFA29. Twin density is proportional to the driving force of the migrating boundaries. This driving force can be substantially changed by adding of impurities such as boron [104]. For example, a drastic reduction from 0.4 twins/grain to 0.1 twins/grain in twin density was reported in a nickel alloy due to the addition of 200 ppm boron [105]. Similarly, Mahajan et al. [106] also found that boron reduced 50 % of  twin density in annealed nickel.  The presence of boron in nickel poisons the grain boundaries [106]. Consequently, the grain boundary migration becomes difficult. Since grain boundary movements are necessary for twin formation, it is expected that the twin density in boron-containing alloys should be lower than that in boron-free specimens. 
            It is worth noting that after aging for 240 h, the twin density in DAFA26 decreased slightly from 22 /mm to 16 /mm. Annealing twins are generated mostly during recrystallization. In the grain growth regime, the evolution of annealing twin density is mainly determined by their propagation, the interaction or the disappearance of the existing twins. Twin boundaries move in order to minimize the total interfacial energy [86]. Jin et al. [87] presented evidence that the annealing twin density increases during recrystallization, but decreases during grain growth in pure nickel.
5.4.5 Mechanical Properties
            After aging 2.4 hours, both DAFA26 and DAFA29 achieved their highest yield strengths at 700ºC compared to samples aged at longer times. This indicates that the maximum strengthening effect from L12 precipitates can be obtained by aging less than 24 h (L12 particle diameter is less than 55 nm).  Figure 5.13 shows the yield strength and elongation as function of aging time.  The yield strength increased first and then decreased due to L12 precipitate coarsening. The elongation for both aged alloys decreased first and then increased. 

Figure 5.13 Yield strength and elongation of DAFA26 and DAFA29 as a function of aging time
            In order to understand the origin of the yield strength obtained for all aged samples, we assume the yield strength was related to the grain size obtained, according to the Hall-Petch relationship:
σy= σ0 + KD-0.5                                                     (5.6)
where σ0 is the off-set stress, D is the average grain size, and K is a constant.  The off-set stress can be expressed by following equation [53]:
σ0 = σppt +σss                                                          (5.7)
where σppt is strengthening contribution due to the presence of L12 precipitates, σss is the strengthening contribution due to solid solution strengthening. σppt can be obtained from following equation [107]:
 (5.8)
where b is the Burgers vector with unit of nm, d is the particle diameter with unit of nm, f is the precipitate volume fraction with unit of % and 10.8 has unit of MPa·nm. The volume fraction of L12 Ni3Al precipitates is 15.4 % in DAFA29 is and 14.8 % in DAFA26 according to JMatPro simulation.
          The calculated σppt and KD-0.5 values are shown in Table 5.3 for both DAFA26 and DAFA29. σss is obtained by subtracting σppt and KD-0.5 values from the yield strength obtained from tensile testing. The solution strengthening values for 240 h-aged DAFA29 is higher than 240 h-aged DAFA26. This solution strengthening must be due to boron in the f.c.c. matrix.  The lattice parameter of f.c.c. matrix for 240 h-aged DAFA29 is also slightly larger than it is in 240h-aged DAFA26 presumably due to the boron.

            MC carbides are present in DAFA29 with a phase fraction much less than 1 wt. % according to JMatPro simulation. These probably have limited effect on the tensile strength of aged DAFA29 alloys. Yamatomo et al. [31] showed that only 0.1 wt.% carbon addition to alloy 41ZC (same as DAFA29) doesn’t have any significant influence on creep performance when compared to 41Z (same as DAFA26).
           240h-aged DAFA29 shows much higher elongation than 240h-aged DAFA26. This elongation difference might be due to the boron influence. It has been found previously that boron additions can increase the ductility of intermetallics and alloys [108, 109]. Wang et al.[88] found boron can improve the elongation by 50 % to 100 % of Fe-Ni alloys after standard heat treatments at temperature from 650ºC to 700ºC. The boron addition increased the grain boundary strength (increase of more obvious dimples) of these Fe-Ni alloys and optimized the M23C6 carbides distribution at grain boundaries.  Zhou et al. [110] found the boron doping of the nickel-based superalloy M951 increased its tensile elongation from 8 % to 28 % in tensile tests at 1100ºC. The boron increases the dislocation motion in the grain boundary and dissipates the strain at the head of dislocation pileups in the vicinity of grain boundaries. These will prevent premature micro-crack formation and consequently produce better ductility [110].  Chiu et al. [111] studied the effect of 0.5 at.% of boron doping on the mechanical properties γ/γ’ nickel-aluminum alloys. Boron doping caused &gt;30 % improvements in tensile elongation for the alloy after homogenization at 1100ºC and prolonged annealing at 1200ºC.  The ductility enhancement by boron has also been observed in other alloy system such as Co-Al-W high-temperature alloys during high temperature tensile tests [112].
            Figure 5.14a and b shows the grain boundary precipitates coverage and elongation as a function of aging time for both aged DAFA26 and DAFA29. The grain boundary precipitates coverage increased as the aging time increased for both DAFA26 and DAFA29. The elongation of DAFA29 also increased as the aging increased from 2.4 h to 240 h, while the elongation for DAFA26 increased first and decreased slightly.  Figure 5.14c shows the grain boundary coverage as a function of elongation for both aged DAFA26 and DAFA29. A correlation between grain boundary coverage and elongation for DAFA29 is found, but not for DAFA26. This might be associated to the boron segregating to the grain boundaries at longer aging times. It was found that boron is preferentially located at interface of matrix and grain boundary precipitates. Tytko et al. [94] detected boron is enriching at M23C6/γ interfaces in Nickel based superalloy (617B) using atom probe tomography (APT).  Li et al. [93] also found boron is preferentially located at phase interface of grain boundary precipitate Ni3Ti and f.c.c. in Ni-Fe alloy by using APT. These boron enrichments were also observed in Fe2Nb laves phase precipitates in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at.%) alloys [91, 92]. As the annealing time increases, grain boundary precipitate coverage will increase in DAFA29. With the coverage increase, more boron will segregate at these grain boundary precipitates interfaces and results in better ductility.

5.5 Conclusions 
1.	The largest strengthening effect from L12 precipitates can be obtained by aging less than 24 h for both AFA alloys. 
2.	During aging, the coarsening behavior of L12 precipitates was the same in both DAFA26 and DAFA29, i.e.: the addition of carbon and boron has no significant effects on the lattice parameter, morphology and size of L12 precipitates in the aged AFA alloys.
3.	Boron enhanced the grain boundary precipitates coverage and suppressed the coarsening of both Laves phase and B2-NiAl in the grain boundaries in AFA alloys
4.	The yield strength of both DAFA26 and DAFA29 decreased as aging time increased. The strength loss is mainly due to the coarsening of L12 precipitates. 
5.	The higher ductility 240h-aged DAFA29 is attributing to the boron addition. The boron increase grain boundary strength and optimize grain boundary precipitates distribution in grain boundaries.
6.	Boron addition in AFA alloys seems suppressed the formation of twins and discontinuous precipitation.  This is mainly due to the impurities impede the migration of grain boundary. 








Chapter 6 Characterizations of Creep Failure Samples of DAFA 29


6.1 Introduction
            In this Chapter, we analyzed DAFA29 specimen after creep failure using optical microscopy, a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The fracture surfaces and deformed cross-sectional surfaces were characterized using a SEM.  The mechanisms for creep failure are analyzed and discussed. 
6.2 Experimental

           The composition of test alloy (DAFA29) is shown in Table 2.1. Two sets of creep tests were performed at ORNL (Oak Ridge, TN) and Carpenter (Reading, PA).  The first creep testing condition was at 750°C and 100 MPa, and the second creep testing condition was at 700°C and 170 MPa. 
6.3 Results
            Figure 6.1a shows a DAFA29 sample after being creep tested at 750°C and 100 MPa.  It has an obvious necked region.  The material fractured at 5,282 h with 39.4% elongation and 44.4% reduction in area at the neck. Figure 6.1b shows an optical micrograph of the fracture surface (cross-sectional view) after creep failure. Figure 6.1c is the side view photograph of this fracture sample.  Many cracks are observed in the necked reign on the edge surface perpendicular to the stress applied direction. Figure 6.1d, e and f are images from the creep specimen tested at 700°C and 170 MP.  This specimen fractured at 8,000 h with a 29% reduction in area. There is no significant difference between the two specimens tested in the two conditions based on the optical microscope images.

          Figure 6.2 shows SE images of the fracture surfaces for the samples creep tested in the two conditions.  Figure 6.2a and b are SE images of creep sample tested at 750°C/100 MPa, while Figure 6.2c and d are for the creep sample tested at 700°C/170 MPa.  Although the specimen tested at 750°C/100 MPa show an elongation of 39.4% at fracture, some cleavage surfaces (as indicated by white arrows) were observed with cavities as shown in Figure 6.2a. These cleavage surfaces with dimples around them indicate it is a mix-fracture model. Figure 6.2b shows one of the cavities formed with a particle in the center in large magnification.  These microvoids (Figure 6b) were observed with a second phase particle such as Laves and/or MC carbides in the center.  The second phase particles are suspected to act as the void initiator to initiate the cracks. During creep, the cracks grow gradually and form the microvoids. The fracture surface of the specimen tested at 700°C/170 MPa is shown in Figure 6.2c. Although the applied stress was almost double, the fracture surface is still similar to specimen in Figure 6.2a with many grain facets (cleavage surfaces) indicating intergranular fracture.

            Figure 6.3 shows the crept region (Figure 6.3a) of the AFA sample tested at 750°C/100 MPa and its control sample (Figure 6.3b).  The control sample is the creep sample head which is simply annealed at 750ºC for 5282 h without any stress applied.  A large number of precipitates appeared in the matrix and grain boundaries for both two samples.  For most precipitates, the B2-NiAl phase coexists with the Laves phase. On the grain boundaries, the B2-NiAl phase and Laves phase precipitates alternately.  For the sample which was creep tested (Figure 6.3a), the large Laves phase precipitates fractured due to the stress applied. Small voids (dark spots in Figure 6.3 as indicated by yellow arrows) are observed for both two crept and control samples.  The number of voids in creep tested samples is more than in the control samples.  















Figure 6.3 BSE images of the creep region (a) and a control sample (b). The sample was creep tested at 750°C/100 MPa, while the control sample is simply aged at 750°C for the same time. (The white arrow in (a) indicates the stress direction)
            Figure 6.4 shows BSE images of one of the cracked regions in DAFA 29 creep failure sample after creep testing at 750°C/100MPa.  Cracks are observed on the grain boundaries where small Laves phase and NiAl precipitates are located.  Most of the cracks initiated from the second phase precipitates and propagated along the grain boundaries where most of Laves and B2 phase precipitates exist.  The grain boundaries behave as a weak path for crack propagation. 
            Most of cracks are around the edge of NiAl and Laves phase precipitates, as shown in Figure 6.4a. A precipitates free zone (PFZ) is located on the edge of these precipitates. Cracks also go through some of NiAl precipitates as shown in Figure 6.4b (indicated by a yellow arrow). The NiAl has a solvus temperature around 800°C in DAFA29 system according to simulation by JMatPro software.  It is soft when creep tested at 750°C which is close to its solvus temperature. 
            There is a transgranular crack observed inside of grain as indicated by a yellow arrow in Figure 6.4a. In some of grain boundaries, cracks also exist even though there are no grain boundary precipitates. This is shown in the lower left corner of Figure 6.4b. No cracking of precipitates in f.c.c. matrix was observed for this specimen.

          The SEM was also used to characterize the microstructure of the sample tested at 700°C/170MPa. Figure 6.5 shows a comparison of microstructures of a crept sample and the corresponding control sample.  There are less grain boundary precipitates formed compare to the sample tested at 750°C/100MPa, see Figure 6.3, due to the lower testing temperature.  Fractured large Laves phase precipitates were not observed.

            Figure 6.6 shows the cracks in the crept region in DAFA29 after testing at 700°C/170 MPa.  The applied stress is almost double of the first test condition. Cracks in the grain boundary Laves phase were present as shown in both Figure 6.6a and b. Most of cracks propagate on the edge of precipitates where a PFZ is located. The PFZ is likely weak due to the lack of precipitates.

            Figure 6.7 show BSE images of electrochemically polished DAFA29 after creep testing at 750°C/100 MPa.  Laves and B2 phases appeared on the matrix surface due to the different electrochemical etching rates between them and the f.c.c. matrix. Spherical L12 precipitates are visible in the f.c.c. matrix and appear as the tiny spherical particles even though after 5282 h creep testing.  On the grain boundaries, there are Laves phase and B2-NiAl phase precipitates, and there is a clear PFZ between grain boundary precipitates and f.c.c. matrix. 

Figure 6.7 BSE images of electrochemically polished surface after creep testing at 750°C/100 MPa. (The large precipitates in f.c.c. matrix are the co-precipitates of Laves phase and NiAl precipitates, while the small precipitates in matrix are L12 precipitates)
            In order to see this PFZ at higher magnification, a TEM was used to perform further analysis. Figure 6.8 shows BF TEM image of a B2-NiAl precipitate and the PFZ around it.  The width of the B2-NiAl precipitate is around 750 nm, while the PFZ is almost the same width as the B2 precipitate. EDS results from PFZ and f.c.c. matrix are shown in Figure 6.8b and c. These results show the microchemistry of the PFZ is mainly composed of Fe, Ni and Cr, while f.c.c. matrix is composed of Fe, Ni, Cr and Al. The f.c.c. matrix has more Ni, Al and Ti than PFZ. This is due to many spherical L12-Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates exist in the f.c.c. matrix. There are almost no L12-Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates observed in this zone, while many L12 particles are located in the f.c.c. matrix with darker contrast.

6.4 Discussion 
            There are cracks observed in DAFA29 after creep testing at both two creep testing conditions (750°C/100 MPa and 700°C/170 MPa) as shown in Figure 6.4 and 6.6. It was found most of the cracks are associated the second phase precipitates in the grain boundaries. They propagate along the grain boundaries or PFZ where most of Laves phase and B2-NiAl phase precipitates exist.  The grain boundaries or PFZ behave as a weak path for crack propagation. This is also evident by the fracture surface as shown in Figure 6.2 with many grain facets indicating intergranular fracture. These Laves phase precipitated along the boundaries can improve the creep strength of the boundaries according to grain boundaries precipitate strengthening mechanism proposed by Takeyama et al. [45, 46]. However, the cracks were still initiated and propagated along the boundaries, which suggests that the boundaries are still the weaker regions for causing fracture of the DAFA29 during creep.
            A wide PZF (~750 nm half width) was observed using both a SEM and a TEM in the grain boundary region adjacent to Laves or B2-NiAl phase precipitates. The PFZ is only solid solution strengthened and softer than the f.c.c. matrix because lack of the precipitate strengthening from L12 precipitates. This zone can allow cracks to propagate more easily compared to in the Laves phase precipitates, B2 precipitates, or f.c.c. matrix. The presence of PFZ has been shown considerably reduce the time to failure in stress rupture tests at elevated temperature [113]. Venkiteswran et al. [101] studied the creep rupture properties of Inconel alloys X-750.  They found that precipitate free zones (PFZs) adjacent to grain boundaries can help to relief of stress concentrations on grain boundary precipitates. However, if the zone is too ductile, it may create large strain concentrations in grain boundary and resulting in enhanced grain boundary shear which may again lead to premature failure.  Srivastava et al. [114] observed cracks and voids formed throughout the specimen and particularly in the precipitate free zone during creep testing of a Ni-based single-crystal superalloy PWA1484.
6.5 Conclusions
            This chapter studied creep failure samples of DAFA29 creep tested in two different conditions.  The fracture surfaces and crack surfaces were characterized using a SEM. It is found that:
1.	Though the Laves and B2-NiAl phase precipitated along the boundaries can improve the creep properties, cracks were still initiated and propagated along the boundaries, which suggests that the boundaries are the weaker regions for causing fracture of the DAFA29 during creep.
2.	A PFZ is observed beside the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates along grain boundaries in the DAFA29 alloy. The PFZ is the weak region when stress applied at elevated temperature and it could potentially provide the path for propagation of cracks.
3.	No cracks were formed on precipitates in the f.c.c. matrix. 


Chapter 7 Conclusions and suggestions for Future Work


7.1	Conclusions
            A solutionizing anneal at 1200ºC followed by cold rolling and annealing at 800ºC can be used to generate a finer-scale and more uniform distribution of Laves phase precipitates in as-received DAFA29 alloy.  However, the solution anneal produced a large increase in grain size from 40 to 250 μm. Heat treated DAFA29 alloys contain Fe2Nb Laves phase, MC carbide, Ni3Al(Ti) L12, and B2 NiAl precipitates after the two thermo-mechanical treatments. During the thermo-mechanical processing, cold rolling produces a high density of dislocations, which act as nucleation sites for Fe2Nb Laves phase, MC carbide, B2 NiAl, and Ni3Al(Ti)  precipitate formation. Meanwhile, nanocrystalline grains were produced after cold rolling and short time anneals, which grow rapidly to micron-scale size on subsequent annealing at 800ºC.  These nanocrystalline steels processed through large strain cold rolling (90 %) exhibit a dramatic increase in yield strength up to 1280 MPa.  The yield strength decreases upon further annealing due to grain growth and precipitate coarsening. The yield strength of thermo-mechanically treated AFA steels exhibits a Hall-Petch relationship with a large value for σ0 that likely arises from precipitate strengthening (σppt) according to analytical simulation.
          Unfortunately, the TMT didn’t increase the yield strengths of AFA alloys at 700ºC, although it significantly enhanced the yield strength of AFA alloys at room temperature. The yield stress of TMT alloys decrease rapidly from 600ºC to 700ºC, which might be because loss of grain boundary strengthening in TMT alloys due to fast dislocation climb at 700ºC. At this temperature, dislocation will be able to move around obstacles easily and the large volume of grain boundaries in TMT alloys work as sites of weakness. The TMT alloys have higher strain rate sensitivity and lower activation volume compared to as-received DAFA29 at elevated temperatures. The higher strain rate sensitivity and lower activation volume are due to the nanocrystalline grain size of the alloys. The strain rate and stress of these TMT alloys satisfy a power law relationship with the stress exponent around 5, whereas the stress exponent is around 4 for the as-received DAFA29. These values ruled out the mechanisms of bulk diffusion and grain boundary diffusion to explain the flow behavior. At 700ºC, dislocation climb is the dominant mechanism for deformation of TMT alloys. When the temperature decreases to 600ºC, the mechanism might change to dislocation shearing indicated by the dramatically increased threshold stress. The flow stress of the as-received AFA alloy is insensitive to strain rate at 600ºC due to strong work hardening at this temperature. It also shows significant serrated flow on the stress strain curve, which might be associated with dynamic strain aging effect.
            After the characterization of aged AFA alloys, we found that the largest strengthening effect from L12 precipitates can be obtained by aging less than 24 h for both AFA alloys. During aging, the coarsening behavior of L12 precipitates was the same in both DAFA26 and DAFA29, i.e.: the addition of carbon and boron has no significant effects on the lattice parameter, morphology and size of L12 precipitates in the aged AFA alloys. Boron enhanced the grain boundary precipitates coverage and suppressed the coarsening of both Laves phase and B2-NiAl in the grain boundaries in AFA alloys. Boron addition in AFA alloys seems suppressed the formation of twins and discontinuous precipitation. This is mainly due to the impurities impede the migration of grain boundary. The yield strength of both DAFA26 and DAFA29 decreased as aging time increased. The strength loss is mainly due to the coarsening of L12 precipitates. The higher ductility 240h-aged DAFA29 is attributing to the boron addition. The boron increase grain boundary strength and optimize grain boundary precipitates distribution in grain boundaries. 
             Though the Laves and B2-NiAl phase precipitated along the boundaries can improve the creep properties, the cracks were still initiated and propagated along the boundaries, which suggests that the boundaries are the weaker regions for causing fracture of the DAFA29 during creep. The wide PFZ is observed beside the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates along grain boundaries in the DAFA29 alloy. It is the weak region when stress applied at elevated temperature and it could potentially provides the path for propagation of cracks. 
7.2 Suggestions for Future Work
7.2.1 The Boron Influence on AFA Alloys
            Although we studied the boron effect on the aged DAFA29 alloys and obtained some preliminary results, the detail effects of boron on the grain boundary is still not understand.  Why small amount of boron addition increases the creep life time significantly in AFA is not clear. In the grain boundary, where the boron is located and what functions it taken into Laves phase, B2-NiAl precipitates or PFZ region need further study. 
            Further experiments of studying segregation behavior of boron on grain boundaries in AFA alloys using EPMA and APT are suggested. 
7.2.2 Creep Tests of TMT alloys
            We performed tensile tests and strain rate jump tests at elevated temperature ranging from 600°C to 800°C.  All TMT alloys show higher yield strengths at room temperature and 600°C.  As the temperature increased to 700°C, all TMT alloys have lower yield strengths than 700°C.  However, the mechanisms of creep tests are different from tensile tests which are normally performed in a very short time. During the creep process, the creep stress may have influence on precipitates compared to the materials that were simply annealed. 
              In order to study the creep performances of all TMT alloys, creep to fracture experiments are suggested for future study.  The deformation mechanisms of AFA alloys and TMT alloys are concluded as dislocation climb mechanism which has no relationship with grain size. Diffusion creep is a function of grain size because grain size influence grain boundary diffusion.  Performing creep tests of TMT alloys will determine the fine grain size influence on the creep performance of AFA alloys.

Abstract 
Alloyed with aluminum to provide corrosion resistance, alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels have shown promise for application in the harsh environments seen in energy production where strong materials that are oxidation and corrosion resistant are needed.  The role of precipitates in AFA-type alloys, Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al and DAFA26 was investigated in this study.
            The effects of cold work on the microstructural evolution during aging of solutionized Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %), was investigated.  Cold work prior to aging at either 700°C or 800°C facilitated the heterogeneous precipitation of both Laves phase and B2-type NiAl precipitates.  While often co-located after cold work, these particles were distinct. γ’-Ni3Al precipitates were also observed in samples aged at 700°C with 90% prior cold work. Compared to material that had not been strained, defects introduced by 50 and 90% cold work at 700°C and 90% cold work at 800°C not only caused a more rapid precipitation in the matrix but also an increase in the total volume fraction of precipitates as compared to material that had been simply aged.
The effect of aging on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) was evaluated.  An increase in the volume fraction of B2 and Laves phase precipitates in the alloy was accompanied by an increase in the yield strength from 205 MPa after the solutionizing anneal up to 383 MPa after aging at 800°C for 1325 h.  After aging for 1325 h, even with extensive intermetallic grain boundary coverage, the alloy showed a room temperature elongation of 19%.
The relationship between the crystallographic orientation of Laves Fe2Nb and B2-NiAl precipitates and their f.c.c. parent matrix was investigated.  Four variants of the m // p, m // p orientation relationship proposed by Denham and Silcock (J. Iron Steel Inst. 207 (1969) 582) were observed for the Laves phase, and six variants of the m // p, m // p Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship were observed for the B2-NiAl phase.
	The microstructural evolution of DAFA26 was also observed.  In addition to Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates, the evolution of the Ni3Al precipitates present in this alloy was investigated.

1.1 Background
Alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels (AFAs) are a new promising class of steels with potential for use in a number of energy-conversion applications [1-10].  For example, currently there is an effort to develop systems requiring power plant materials that can work in the ultra super critical (USC) range of 760C/ 35 MPa.  These materials must have excellent creep and corrosion resistance.  Increasing the operating temperature improves efficiency with the added benefit of reducing CO2 emissions [11-14].  The relatively low cost of ferritic steels make them desirable candidates, but they have yet to show the creep strength and oxidation resistance needed at high temperatures.  Nickel-based superalloys can be used at temperatures in excess of 760°C, but their higher cost, correlated with higher Ni content, makes them less desirable for most applications [13, 14].  In order for an AFA to be a viable alternative, it must have a strength and creep resistance that are close to, or exceeds that, of Ni-based alloys.  AFAs have relied on MC carbides for strength [1, 3, 4, 15], but at temperatures greater than 800C there is concern that the carbides formed could coarsen and dissolve [4].  Even with an inlet steam temperature to the turbine of 700-760 ºC, the average metal temperature in superheater and reheater parts could run up to 815 ºC [16]. 
Alumina (Al2O3)-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels have the potential to decrease our reliance on expensive Ni-base alloys for aggressive conditions in energy production and chemical processing environments  [17].  AFAs use alumina as a protective oxide scale for high corrosion resistance instead of chromia.  Alumina is known to offer even better protection than chromia at high temperatures [18, 19].  AFA stainless steels were in development as early as the 70s [20] and more recently a new family of AFAs has received attention [1, 3, 9, 10, 17].  In the newer grades of AFAs, the single-phase austenitic microstructure needed for creep strength can be obtained, and MC-base precipitates or γ’-Ni3Al have been used for creep strength [9, 10, 17].  Unfortunately, optimization of these alloys is difficult because the effects that different alloying elements and precipitates have on the creep strength of these steels is complex and oftentimes, not well understood.  AFAs have a wide composition range and continued study of this system is needed to find the optimal combination of alloying elements that provide the best effectiveness (e.g. superior creep strength) with a balance of cost for future commercialization [17].  
Even when isolating research efforts to focus on understanding particular grades of AFAs, it can be difficult to understand the influence of precipitate phases on creep strength. is difficult.  Phases that are beneficial in some cases can cause decreased creep strength in others.  There are generally 3 grades of AFAs that are being investigatedunder investigation, based on nickel content: 20-25 wt. % Ni grade AFA, 12Ni grade AFA, and 32Ni grade AFA.   Substituting Ni with Mn to achieve the 12Ni grade AFAs has been explored since Mn helps to stabilize austenite relative to the deleterious δ–Fe phase and would be an ideal Ni substitute to lower cost.  However, this grade of AFAs with Mn has shown relatively poor creep resistance although and the reason for the decreased creep strength is not well understood [10, 17].   In 20-25 Ni grade alloys it has been found that the total weight fraction of carbide phases as well as supersaturation is important.  For example, a 25Ni grade alloy with 2.53 wt. % Nb (0.201 wt. % C) there was little MC supersaturation and it showed poor creep resistance compared to 25Ni grade alloys with 1wt. % Nb and 0.1 wt. % C.  It is believed that the 2.53 wt. % Nb alloy showed poorer creep strength because the 2.53 wt. % Nb addition decreased the supersaturation of MC carbides (M is primarily Nb) [17].  Thise 1 wt. % Nb and 0.1wt. % C level range has been shown to be an optimal saturation range for MC carbide strengthening in other studies of AFAs as well [3, 7].  While increased Nb content from 1wt. % to 2.5 wt. % seemed to have a detrimental role in creep strength for a 25Ni alloy, in the 32Ni grade alloys with 3.3 Nb wt. %, superior creep strength has been observed at 650ºC.  The superior creep strength is considered to be caused by γ’-Ni3Al precipitate strengthening.  This level of creep strength is around 5x greater than the best carbide strengthened 20-25 Ni alloy.  While γ’-Ni3Al improved properties in the 32Ni alloy, at 650°C it is believed that metastable γ’-Ni3Al  caused decreased rupture time in a 25Ni-4Al-1Nb alloy with increased C content compared to a 25Ni-3Al-1Nb alloy. Though the creep strength was promising there was a tradeoff, and the 32Ni grade alloy saw reduced creep elongation which is thought to be due to σ-phase formation that needs to be addressed.  At 750ºC, the 32Ni alloy creep results were comparable to the 20-25 and 12Ni alloy grades [17]. 
Work to increase γ’-Ni3Al stability and decrease σ-phase stability has been done in 32Ni grade alloys.  32Ni alloys with decreased chromium content (14 wt. % versus 19 wt. %) and additional alloying elements such as Zr and Ti have less σ-phase formation and improved creep properties.  A 32 Ni grade alloy with Zr and Ti and small additions of carbon and boron had a creep-rupture life that exceeded that of a commercially available Fe-base alloy by an order of magnitude [21].  The mechanisms that allow for the improvement in creep properties with boron addition in AFAs are not well understood. A Laves phase strengthened austenitic alloy with a similar base composition of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at. %) had improved creep properties with the addition of boron due to an increase in Laves phase grain boundary precipitation [22-24], but in the 32Ni grade AFAs studied, the boron addition did not seem to have a significant effect on grain boundary precipitation.  It was hypothesized that the boron addition formed a strain field in the matrix that increased resistance to creep deformation [21].  While computational methods have helped to limit deleterious phases such as the sigma phase and to help achieve an austenitic matrix, it has been made clear that the additions of small alloying elements and their effect on the properties of AFAs needs to be characterized using advanced characterization techniques such as the TEM and the atom probe.  Even with an understanding of what phases may be present, creep mechanisms in this system are not well understood enough to predict which potential strengthening precipitate is the most beneficial for creep strength.  For many of the AFA alloys that have also been tensile tested, it is hard to find correlation between creep and tensile properties.  For example in 20-25 Ni grade AFA, while B2-NiAl and Laves precipitation is thought to improve tensile properties, it is the presence of MC carbides would showthat has a strong influence on creep strength [10, 17].  
HTUPS (high-temperature ultrafine-precipitation-strengthened steel) alloys, modified for Al2O3 formation, a precursor to AFAs [1, 25], {Yamamoto, 2007 #1}as well as an AFA-type alloy [15] have been cold worked to enhance the precipitation of nanoscale MC carbide precipitates during creep to improve creep resistance.  Nucleation on dislocations haveNucleation on dislocations has been shown to be a possible route to reduce the size and increase the volume fraction of these precipitates in the matrix so that they effectively pin dislocations and extend creep life.  Previous studies of other materials have used pre-straining via cold work and subsequent aging to control particle precipitation [26-28]. 

1.2 Common AFA precipitates
1.2.1 C-14 Laves phase
The AB2-type Laves phase generally exists as one of three topologically close-packed (TCP) structures: hexagonal MgZn2 (C14), cubic MgCu2 (C15) and hexagonal MgNi2 (C36) [29].  The A atom is the larger of the two atoms [30].  The space group of the C14 structure is P63/mmc. Figure 1.1 shows a schematic of the C14 structure. 

Figure 1.1: Hexagonal C14 Fe2Nb (AB2) Laves phase structure. The large yellow spheres represent Nb (A atoms) and the smaller black spheres represent Fe (B atoms).

The stacking of the C14 structure along the (0001) planes is similar to the ABAB stacking sequence for hcp structures [31].  For the Laves phase, there are 6 fundamental four-layer stacking schemes that can be combined to form the Laves phase structure as described by Komura [32] and 2 make up the C14 structurpolytype.  The two layers form in the close-packed direction and follow an AB’AB’-pattern or a stacking sequence of: αAαcßBßc… where αAαc represents the ‘A’ and ßBßc represents the ‘B’’ in the pattern as shown in Figure 1.2 [33].

Even though Laves phase has been shown to be harmful in some ferritic steels [34], decreasing toughness and strength and  precipitating at the grain boundary, there has been little research into its presence in austenitic steels [35].  In a study of a quartenaryquaternary Fe-20Cr-(25-40)Ni-(2-4)Nb (at. %) system Takeyama et al. [36]  observed fine, spherical C14 precipitates in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at. %) and Fe-20Cr-25Ni-2Nb (at. %)  noting that the morphology of the precipitates became finer with a lower nickel content [35].  When Takeyama et al. examined quarternaryquaternary alloys of Fe-20Cr-(25-35)Ni-2Nb (at. %) they observed that with an increased nickel content of 35 at. % the Fe2Nb precipitates were elongated with visible interfacial dislocations, but with 25 at. % nickel the precipitates were smaller and more equiaxed.  They also looked at the precipitation of Laves phase on the grain boundary and within the grain for the Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at. %) system after aging.  They constructed a Time-Temperature-Precipitation (TTP) diagram and found that after aging for 4.32 Ms at 800°C Laves phase particles also precipitated homogeneously in the matrix with grain boundary precipitates being larger than those in the matrix. The TTP also showed much slower precipitation kinetics at 700°C. Takeyama’s analysis indicated that the formation of the Laves phase was diffusion controlled by the Nb in austenite [37].  In 316 austenitic stainless steels, it was speculated that an acceleration of intermetallic precipitation could occur due to the speeding up of substitutional diffusion via an increased defect concentration.  Laves-phase precipitation was accelerated after cold work and it was hypothesized that it was the result of increased diffusivity of elements that made up the Laves phase [38].   

1.2.2 B2-NiAl
The AB B2-NiAl phase has a cubic CsCl crystal structure (Figure 1.3).  The space group of the B2 structure is.  The B2-NiAl structure can be treated as two interpenetrating simple cubic lattices consisting of A and B atoms  A-type atoms are positioned at the (0, 0, 0) corner site and B atoms are at the (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) center site [39].

Figure 1.3:  B2-NiAl structure.  The purple spheres represent nickel “A” atoms occupying the corner sites and the smaller blue sphere in the center site represents the aluminum “B” atom.
B2 particles are spherical in some materials such as precipitation-hardenable martensitic stainless steels [40] and have also shown plate-like morphology in Fe-Ni-Cr-Al (FNCA) alloys [41, 42].  Stoichiometric B2-NiAl has been extensively studied and polycrystalline NiAl is generally seen as being brittle at room temperature with a sharp increase in ductility above 0.45 Tm [43].  B2 precipitates in AFAs have shown similarities to the bulk NiAl alloys, being strong but brittle at room temperature and showing ductility and decreased strengthening effects at 750°C, above the ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) [44].
1.2.3 L12 Ni3Al
The L12 (AuCu3) structure is cubic with formula A3B is an ordered f.c.c. structure (Figure 1.4). The space group of the L12 structure is .  The L12 Ni3Al phase is known as gamma prime (γ’).  In superalloys it is used as a strengthener.  Al atoms make up the corners of the structure and Ni atoms make up the face center [45].  The Ni3(Al,Ti) L12 phase has been shown to have strengthening effects in AFAs [21]. 

Figure 1.4:.  Crystal structure of the AB3 L12 γ’-Ni3Al phase.  The gray spheres represent the nickel “A” atoms and the blue spheres represent the aluminum “B” atoms.

1.2.4 Nucleation of Precipitates
Nucleation on dislocations was modeled by Cahn [46] in 1957 and occurs because it lowers strain energy .  The strain contrast that is present in TEM images of Fe2Nb that has precipitated in austenite in Fe-20Cr-35Ni-2Nb and Fe-20Cr-25Ni-2Nb after aging at 800ºC [37] is indicative of a semi-coherent precipitate-matrix interface and is thought to be a reason why the Laves phase has shown stability during aging and creep testing at 800 ºC [47].  According to Denham and Silcock [48] Fe2Nb shows only a moderate misfit in austenite with 5% contraction perpendicular to the planes and a 9% expansion within.  Weatherly described a mechanism where prismatic punching could cause the nucleation of dislocations [49].  In a ferritic alloy parallel plate precipitates were believed to have been caused by an autocatalytic reaction.  It was proposed that precipitates may have formed on quenched in dislocations and then caused new dislocations to form and act as nucleation sites [50].  
	Heterogeneous nucleation often does not solely occur on dislocations, but also takes place on grain boundaries since the grain boundary activation energy is lower than that for nucleation on a dislocation.  For a grain size of 50 µm and a sufficient dislocation density (1 x 1016 m-2) the number of atoms on the grain boundary versus dislocation nucleation sites is comparable.  If the energy reduction that would occur by precipitating on a grain boundary is small, precipitation on dislocations can make up a large fraction of total precipitation [51].  
1.3 Creep for Dispersion-Strengthened Materials
         In 1988 Rösler and Artz proposed that dislocation attachment might be thermally activated [52] and in 1990 [53] they revisited the predominant creep equation used at the time and proposed a new model of the creep behavior of dispersion-strengthened alloys that took this thermal activation into account in order to understand the ‘unusual’ behavior of dispersion-strengthened alloys: 


where  is the strain rate, 2λ is the mean free path between obstacles (~ the distance between particles), ρ is the density of dislocations, b is the Burger’s vector, D is the self-diffusion coefficient, G is the shear modulus, r is the particle radius, k is the relaxation parameter (0 ≤ k ≤ 1), σ is the engineering stress and σd is (1-k2)1/2σOr with σOr being the Orowan stress required to escape the particles, kB is the Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the temperature.  Using this model they were able to show that one could predict an optimum particle size with a given volume fraction.  Since dispersion-strengthened alloys use particles under 100 nm in size, the 300- 500 nm sized Fe2Nb particles that have been attained thus far would be more beneficial if they were refined further [9]. 

1.4 Orientation Relationships
1.4.1 Fe2Nb Denham and Silcock Orientation Relationship
The orientation relationship(OR) between Laves phase particles and the f.c.c. matrix in AFAs has not been studied extensively.  The relationship observed by Denham and Silcock [48] for Laves phase precipitates in an f.c.c. alloy with Fe, Cr, Ni, Nb and other minor constituents, and also in a Fe-16.2Cr-14.3Ni-1.2Nb (at. %)  alloy with minor alloying additions [54] was determined to be:
(0001)Fe2Nb // (111)γ
Fe2Nb // γ

Though this orientation relationship appears to be the most observed between C14 Laves and austenitic structures, others are possible within austenite.  In a study of the Laves phase orientation with that of ferrite, for example,, different orientation relationships were observed and was proposed to have a significant effect on particle morphology [55].

1.4.2 B2-NiAl Kurdjumov-Sachs Orientation Relationship
The Kurdjumov-Sachs (K-S) orientation relationships (OR) is one of the ORs that can be observed in the study of austenite-martensite transformations [56].  This OR is described as:
 
.
24 different variants are possible in this orientation relationship since austenite has 4  planes and each  plane contains 3 different &lt;110&gt; directions that can be parallel to 2 different bcc-α &lt;111&gt; directions [57].
The orientation relationship of B2-NiAl particles wasere observed to follow the K-S orientation relationship in an Fe-Ni-Cr-Al (FNCA) alloy [41, 42] with B2-NiAl precipitates that had a plate-like morphology.  In that case, two K-S orientation relationship variants were observed.  In a study of f.c.c. Co precipitates in a B2-ordered (Ni,Co)Al alloy [58], 3 variants of the K-S orientation relationship were observed and it was noted that the ratio of the lattice parameters of the f.c.c and b.c.c. phase can influence the orientation relationship.  

	
1.5 Overview of research project
The Laves phase Fe2Nb and B2-NiAl precipitates commonly found in AFAs can strongly influence the material properties.  Intermetallic Fe2Nb Laves-phase precipitates have shown long-term stability at high temperature and have the potential to further improve the performance of alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) alloys.  Further refinement of Fe2Nb precipitates could allow these materials to meet the demand for even better creep life and high temperature strength.  The insights gained from an understanding of the fundamental and underlying causes of mechanical and microstructural responses observed in a model AFA alloy, Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al can be extended to different classes of AFAs, as well as other austenitic stainless steels with complex matrix-precipitate relationships.  

In chapter 3 the effect of cold Work on the Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-Al is described with a discussion of observed microstructural change and precipitate evolution as the material is aged.

Chapter 4 focuses on the microstructure of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al under different aging conditions in order to understand the effects of aging on the precipitation of Fe2Nb Laves phase as well as B2-NiAl precipitates.  The effect of these precipitates on the mechanical properties of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-Al is determined.

Chapter 5 details the orientation relationship observed between the Laves phase and NiAl particles and the austenitic matrix.

In Chapter 6 the microstructure of an AFA alloy, DAFA26, is also observed and the evolution of NiAl, Laves phase and L12 precipitates is described.




















Chapter 2  Experimental Methods

2.1 Introduction
This chapter details the materials processing methods and techniques involved in this work.  
2.2 Materials Preparation
2.2.1 Vacuum Arc Melting
Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (compositions expressed in atomic percent) was investigated.  Professor Easo George provided Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al ingots that had been arc melted and drop cast into a copper mold 15.2 cm long x 2.5 cm in diameter under argon.  Common cast features [59] were observed: there was some segregation and a central pore was created during the solidification process.  Samples were also prepared by Sophisticated Alloy, Inc and vacuum arc melted into 200 g buttons.
Fe-14Cr-25Ni-2.5Nb-0.1Si-3.6Al (wt. %) samples were prepared by arc melting at Thayer in a Centorr Associates, Inc. 5BJ bell jar furnace.  ~50-60 g samples were made from pieces of 99.97+%  Fe, 99.99% Cr, 99.95+% Ni, 99.9% Al, and 99.9999%  Si.  Pieces were put into a water-cooled copper crucible and arc melted in an argon atmosphere to prevent oxidation.  After being melted, the sample was flipped and re-melted at least twice to ensure it was well-mixed.




2.2.2 Sectioning and Machining
Samples that were arc-melted went through processing to prepare them for materials characterization.  Samples were sectioned using one of two saws: a high-speed, custom-built saw with a water-cooled aluminum oxide cutoff wheel was used for rough cutting of bulk samples, and.  A a water-cooled low speed South Bay Technology, Inc. Model 650 diamond saw was used for precise cutting of smaller samples.  A Trak DPM SX3P Bed Mill with Proto TRAK SMX Control along with two and three-axis control was used for machining samples.

2.2.3 Homogenization
Arc melted samples were homogenized for 24 hours at 1250ºC using a Lindberg Type 54233 7200 watt closed-shell tube furnace with a max temperature of 1500ºC.  A Lindberg Type 59545 controller was used to control the temperature.  36” long alumina tubes with a 2” outer diameter, 1-3/4” inner diameter, were used in the furnace.  Samples were placed in alumina crucibles and loaded into the center of the alumina tube.  An MTI vacuum sealing assembly made of stainless steel was placed on either side of the tube andwith had  a vacuum meter with valve on one end.  Porous alumina blocks were placed inside either end of the tube in order to prevent the melting of the rubber O-rings of the vacuum sealing assembly.  The assembly was altered at one end to include an Omega type R thermocouple which was shielded by an alumina sheath and monitored by an Omega Dpi32 themocouplethermocouple meter.  A vacuum was obtained using an Edward E2M1.5 oil sealed rotary vane pump.  After loading a sample and closing the vacuum assembly, the tube was flushed with argon and a ~0.02 MPa pressure was maintained to prevent oxidation of the sample.  After a homogenization treatment samples were quickly removed and water-quenched.  
The 1250°C homogenization temperature was chosen after consideration of the quaternary tetrahedron of the Fe-Cr-Ni-Nb quaternary system at 1200°C (Figure 2.1a) as well as from illustrations of the phase equilibria (Figure 2.1b) as a function of Ni and Nb with 20 % Cr content in Fe-Cr-Ni-Nb which was described by Takeyama and others [36].   Based on the quaternary system and phase equilibria illustrations, increasing the Ni content increases the ability for the Fe-Cr-Ni-Nb system to form a single phase γ-matrix at 1200°C.  For Fe-20Cr-25Ni-2Nb-5Al at. %, a single phase microstructure was not achieved after a 24 h heat treatment at 1250°C, but when the Ni content in increased to 30 at.  % (Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al at. %), a single phase microstructure can be obtained.

2.2.4 Annealing
Samples were annealed at 700 and 800ºC for 10 min to 3000 hours using a Thermolyne Type 47900 box furnace.  The samples were put inside alumina crucibles, annealed in air, and water-quenched at the end of the heating treatment.  

2.2.5 Cold Work
To cold work samples, an International Rolling Mills/Mario Di Maio Type LS200 two-high 4.2” rolling mill was used.  Specimens were milled to 4 mm x 4 mm x ~13mm, and some were cold-rolled with approximately a 0.3 mm reduction per pass until the desired thickness reduction (50 or 90% ±1%) was achieved.  

2.3 Materials Characterization
2.3.1 X-ray diffraction 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on bulk samples using a Rigaku D/Max 2000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm) to examine bulk samples and the effects of aging on precipitate evolution.  A tube voltage of 40 kV and anode current of 300 mA was used.  Measurements were performed by scanning from 20° to 120° using a step size of 0.01° with a count time of 1 s per step giving a total scan time of ~3 h.  The bulk samples were cut from treated ingots and polished with successively finer grits of silicon carbide paper, up to 1200-grit SiC paper and with 0.3 and 0.05 µm alumina powder in water to obtain a mirror finish.  Jade software was used to identify phases in the alloys and to analyze the diffraction patterns.


2.3.2 Metallography
Grain size determination was done by polishing samples to a mirror finish and then etching in an immersion of Kalling’s Reagent, which is a solution of CuCl2, HNO3, ethanol, and water.  (Figure 2.2).  Grains were examined and measured using a light microscope equipped with a digital camera (Figure 2.2).  .

2.3.3 Scanning electron microscopy
Microstructures were examined using a FEI XL30 field emission gun (FEG) scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated at 15 kV and equipped with an electron backscatter detector (EBSD) and an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The EDS system used a lithium-drifted silicon, thin-window, Z  4 detector with an acquisition rate of up to 10,000 counts per second.  A working distance of 10 mm was used for both imaging and EDS.  Samples were observed under high vacuum (~8 x 10-9 torr) and using either secondary electron (SE) or back-scattered electron (BSE) imaging.  

2.3.4 Transmission electron microscopy 
An EDS-equipped FEI Tecnai FS20ST FEG TEM operated at 200 kV was used to examine transmission electron microscope (TEM) specimens. TEM samples were made by cutting rectangular bars and milling them into 3 mm diameter cylinders.  Disks were then cut out from the cylindrical rods.  These discs were mechanically thinned and polished to ~100µm thick and electropolished using a Struers TenuPol-5 twin-jet electropolisher at a voltage of 11 V with a current of ~180 mA using an electrolyte of 25 % nitric acid in methanol at -20°C.  The thin foils were placed in a conventional double-tilt holder with a capability of tilting 60º along two axes for observation.   

2.3.5 Diffraction Analysis
Experimental selected area diffraction patterns were simulated using CrystalMaker® 9.1.3 and SingleCrystal® 2.3.1 software.  Pattern indexing and lattice parameter determination was calculated using MDI Jade 2010 software.
2.3.6 Atom Probe Tomography
Atom probe tomography (APT) work was supported through the SHaRE program through collaboration with Dr. M.K. Miller and Dr. Lan Yao at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS), sponsored by the Scientific User Facilities Divisions, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy.
A Cameca Instruments local electrode atom probe (LEAP), was used to study the 3D morphology of metallic samples and to better understand the composition profile of phases and the overall sample (Figure 2.3). 




Figure 2.3:  LEAP 4000X HR used to make 3D observations and determine composition profiles of samples.
Figure 2.4 shows a diagram that illustrates the basics of atom probe tomography. The LEAP operates in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and contains three-chambers, one of which includes a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ToFMS).  The ToFMS includes the specimen, the local electrode, and crossed delay line detector that detects the ions extracted from the specimen [60].  The atom probe is essentially a combination of a field ion microscope and a mass spectrometer.  In the LEAP a needle-shaped specimen is mounted facing a local electrode (LE) on a nanopositioning stage that is cryogenically cooled. The local electrode is placed approximately one aperture diameter away (20-50 µm).   A high voltage pulse is applied so that ions are field evaporated from the specimen. Layer-by-layer, ions that are field evaporated are collected and analyzed in the ToFMS [61].

Specimens were annularly milled in an FEI Nova 200 dual beam focused ion beam (FIB)-SEM after electropolishing in a solution of 2 % perchorlic acid in 2-butoxyethanol.  Some samples were also fabricated by annular milling and a lift-out procedure (Figure 2.5) [63].  After sample preparation LEAP analyses were performed in voltage mode at a specimen temperature of 50 K (-223ºC), a pulse fraction of 0.2, and a pulse repetition rate of 200 kHz.

Atom maps, isoconcentration surfaces, and proximity histograms are common methods for analyzing atom probe data.  Isoconcentration surfaces can be used to better understand the morphology and distribution of phases [62].  Proximity histograms, as described by Hellman et. al [64], were constructed from isoconcentration surfaces. Proximity histograms are useful for detecting concentration variations between interfaces.   The proximity histogram is constructed such that an interface is created between two phases and the closest distance of an atom to either side of a reference surface is plotted as a function of distance from the interface [65].  

2.4 Vickers hardness testing
Samples were mounted into pucks made of a phenolic resin and then polished to a mirror finish.  Hardness tests were performed using a TIME TH-713 Microhardness Tester.  Tests were performed using a load of 1.96 N (200g) and a 15 second dwell time at room temperature.  At least 10 indents were made for each condition and the standard deviation of the averages is reported.
2.5 Tensile testing
Flat, dog-bone tensile specimens approximately 1.27 mm thick, with an overall length of 12.7 mm, and gauge length of 10 mm were prepared by milling followed by sectioning on a high-speed saw.  The specimens were polished up to 1200-grit SiC paper and finished with 0.3 µm alumina powder to eliminate surface defects.  Tensile tests were conducted in air at room temperature using an MTS or Instron model 5969 at an initial strain rate of 5 x 10-4 s-1.  Up to four tests were performed for each aging condition.  Samples were preloaded prior to testing.   Figure 2.6 shows the new tensile sample holder that was designed for room-temperature tests.  The new holder improved sample stability during testing, prevented tensile samples from falling out during the loading process, and decreased the number of repeat tests that had to be performed due to samples not breaking along the gauge length.  Figure 2.6d shows the dimensions of a typical tensile specimen.  Percent elongation was determined from measurements of the gauge length of specimens taken before and after fracture using an optical microscope.

True strain () and true stress (σ) were calculated from the load-displacement data and the work-hardening exponent was determined using the Hollomon equation [66]: σ = K(n, where K is the strength coefficient that is equal to the true stress when ɛ  = 1, and n is the strain-hardening exponent.  This equation can be rewritten log(σ) = log(K) + nlog(). Thus, by plotting log(σ) versus log() for the uniform plastic deformation range, and fitting a straight line to the data, n can be determined from the slope, i.e. n = dlog(σ)/dlog().  For materials with inhomogeneous yielding, the plastic portion is considered starting from the lower yield point.  

2.6 Image Analysis
SEM images taken at 8000x were processed and analyzed using ImageJ [67].  BSE images were used for particle analysis since BSE atomic number contrast allowed for optimal differentiation and detection of the matrix, Laves phase, and NiAl precipitates.  The image processing routine included contrast enhancement followed by thresholding to include bright or dark contrasted regions to delineate Laves or NiAl particles, respectively.  Images were then despeckled and outlier filters were run and small artifacts removed in the final binarized image.  The particle parameters calculated include area fraction and equivalent circle diameter given as 2(A/π)1/2), of a circle with equivalent area A .  SEM resolution limits and image quality was ere taken into account in order to minimize error.  Segmented areas that had low pixel counts that corresponded to particles with a diameter smaller than 20-60nm were excluded from the results. 
The particle nearest-neighbor distance, λ was determined for each aging condition from the equation [68] :
 
where PA is the particle density or point density and is equal to the particle count divided by the area of the image field of view [69].  Grain boundary coverage was calculated using BSE images.  The percent coverage was found by subtracting segments of the grain boundary devoid of Laves and NiAl precipitates from the total grain boundary length and then dividing by the total grain boundary length. 



Chapter 3  Effect of Cold Work on the Microstructure of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al alloy
3 
This chapter is largely derived from: G. Trotter, et. al., Accelerated precipitation in the AFA stainless steel Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al via cold working, Intermetallics, 53 (2014) 120-128.
3.1 Introduction
In order for an AFA to be a viable alternative, in energy applications, it must have a strength and creep resistance that are close to or exceed those of Ni-based alloys.  AFAs have relied on MC carbides for strength [1, 3, 4, 15], but at temperatures greater than 800C there is concern that the carbides formed could coarsen and dissolve [4].  
Further refinement of the Fe2Nb Laves phase particles has potential to improve the creep life and high temperature strength of AFAs.  Fe2Nb Laves phase particles have shown long-term stability at high temperatures [9, 15, 37, 44].  However, previous studies that looked to Laves phase particles for strength have only seen low or moderate creep resistance [9, 15].   Decreasing the precipitate size and increasing the volume fraction would enable the precipitates to effectively pin dislocations and extend creep life.  A Laves phase dispersion with particles less than 100 nm in diameter is recommended to obtain creep-levels on-par with MC carbide strengthened austenitic stainless steels [9]. 
One pathway to reducing the size and increasing the volume fraction of Laves phase precipitates in the matrix is to nucleate precipitates on dislocations.  Nucleation on dislocations is an effect first modeled by Cahn [46] in 1957 and occurs because it lowers the total strain energy of an embryo.  In order to effectively reduce the interfacial energy, precipitates that nucleate on dislocations should be well-matched on at least one matrix plane so they are able to form low-energy coherent or semi-coherent interfaces [51].  Images of Fe2Nb that has precipitated in austenite alloys that have the base components of AFAs (Fe-20Cr-35Ni-2Nb and Fe-20Cr-25Ni-2Nb) [37] show strain contrast in TEM images that is indicative of a semi-coherent precipitate-matrix interface, making Fe2Nb a promising candidate for precipitation on dislocations in AFA-type alloys.
	Prestraining via cold work introduces dislocations that could dramatically affect the precipitation of the Laves phase, similar to what has been observed in previous studies of other precipitate systems [26-28, 38].  The effectiveness of prestraining before aging in changing microstructure and improving material properties depends on characteristics of the particular alloy system analyzed and the synergy of a number of different variables including, but not limited to: aging temperature, the amount of prestrain, and competing precipitation phenomena.  For example, the improved hardness observed in a copper-bearing steel that had been pre-strained prior to aging at 300°C was attributed to additional particle nucleation on dislocations or excess vacancies arising from prestraining, however at an aging temperature of 500°C the prestrain had little effect on hardness or particle nucleation [26].  In aluminum alloys cold work has been shown to have different effects in particular alloy systems, with dislocations enhancing hardening by providing nucleation sites for precipitates in the Al-Cu, Al-Cu-Mg, and Al-Cu-Li systems, while not proving effective for producing hardening in other aluminum systems [70]. Severe plastic deformation by cold rolling at room temperature followed by subsequent aging has been shown to improve both strength and ductility in a high strength Al-Mg-Si alloy [28] as well as a Cu-Ag alloy [27].  An increase in precipitation after cold work has been observed with other precipitates in alloys more closely related to AFAs.  HTUPS (high-temperature ultrafine-precipitation-strengthened steel) alloys, modified for Al2O3 formation, are cold worked to enhance the precipitation of nanoscale MC carbide precipitates during creep [1, 15, 25].  While aging studies on AFA-type alloys have been done in the past [44], Laves phase precipitates have yet to be targeted via a combined aging and cold working approach. 
In this study, the effect of cold work on a solution-annealed AFA-type alloy, Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) was investigated by comparing samples that had received cold work prior to aging to those that were simply aged. Microstructural analysis was performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).  In addition, the effect of cold work and aging on the hardness of the material was examined. 

3.2 Experimental
The as-cast material was homogenized in vacuum for 24 h at 1250°C, then water-quenched.  This solutionizing treatment was used since SEM investigations confirmed that it enabled the formation of a solutionized single phase matrix. Unrolled, 50% rolled, and 90% rolled samples were aged in air for 24 h and 240 h at 700°C, and for 2.4, 24, and 240 h at 800°C.  Microstructures were observed using a FEI XL30 field emission gun (FEG) SEM operated at 15 kV and a FEI Tecnai F20ST FEG operated at 200 kV, both equipped with EDS.
3.3 Results 
Figure 3.1Figure 1 shows bright-field TEM images with accompanying selected area diffraction (SAD) patterns of precipitates observed in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at.%).  After the solution treatment the average grain size was 865 µm.  Figure 3.1Figures 1a and 1b show microstructural features after the alloy was aged at 800°C for 24 hours and Figure 3.1Figure 1c shows the alloy after 50% cold work prior to aging at 240 h.  TEM examination confirmed that the alloy had an f.c.c. austenitic (γ) matrix (Figure 3.1a) and that the lighter precipitates observed in the SEM backscattered electron (BSE) images (see later) are C14-type Fe2Nb phase (Figure 3.1b) and that the darker precipitates are B2-ordered NiAl (Figure 3.1c).  The presence of both Laves phase and NiAl precipitates is in agreement with previous TEM analysis on precipitates in this alloy [9] and is typical of AFA-type alloys [1-7, 17, 21].

After sufficient aging and/or prior cold work Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates often appear interconnected.  For example, Figure 3.2 shows a dark field STEM image and EDS elemental maps of a specimen reduced by 50% and then aged for 240 h at 800°C.  The EDS maps and spectral data of Laves and B2-precipitates reveal that while the nickel makes up a large component of the matrix, it couples with the aluminum and is concentrated in the NiAl particles.  Compared to the B2 precipitate, the Nb-rich Laves phase precipitate has a lower aluminum (1.5 at. % vs. 20.7 at. %) and nickel (18 at. % vs. 43.6 at. %) content, and a higher iron (40 at. % vs. 25.1 at. %), chromium (15.0 at. % vs. 10.2 at. %) and aluminum (25.5 at. % vs. 0.4 at. %) content.  The EDS maps also reveal that while often co-located after cold work, the NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitates are distinct.

TEM investigation of specimens after 90% cold work followed by aging at 700°C show the presence of fine γ’-Ni3Al (L12) precipitates (Figure 3.3).  These precipitates have been observed in creep rupture samples of this alloy at 750°C 100 MPa and were noted to improve creep resistance [9].

Microstructural changes are shown as a function of rolling reduction and annealing time after aging at 700°C in  Figure 3.4Figure 4.  When the Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) alloy is as-aged at 700°C without prior cold work, no Laves phase precipitates were visible in the BSE images of the matrix up to 240 h (Figure 3.4 a,d).   With cold work prior to aging at 700°C both the B2 and Laves phase particles are globular in shape and are almost always coupled together in the matrix (Figure 3.4 b, c, e, f).  Specimens with 50% (Figure 3.4Figure 4b) and 90% (Figure 3.4c) cold work prior to aging for 24 h at 700°C had a non-uniform, but fine distribution of Laves phase particles with slightly larger B2 particles in the matrix.  A similar pattern of increased precipitation after cold work was observed after a 240 h anneal at 700°C (Figure 3.4d-f).

Figure 3.5 shows the microstructural evolution of the alloy at 800°C as a function of rolling reduction and annealing time.  At 800°C the microstructural response to aging and cold work was markedly different to that at 700°C.  NiAl and Laves phases precipitated at 800°C, but Ni3Al particles were not stable at this temperature.  Unlike at 700°C, at 800°C with no cold work, precipitates are visible both in the matrix and on the grain boundaries after 2.4 h (Figure 3.5a).  The Laves phase precipitates are elongated.  Precipitates on the grain boundary are larger than those in the matrix and there are no NiAl precipitates visible in the matrix, but they are present on the grain boundary. After 24 h there is a significant increase in the size of the Laves phase precipitates in the matrix and some are coupled with the B2-ordered NiAl precipitates (Figure 3.5d).  The Laves phase precipitates are needle-like and have several preferred orientations in the matrix.  After 240 h more NiAl particles are present.  From Figure 3.5g they do not appear to be homogeneously distributed in the matrix, but are co-located with Laves phase precipitates similar to the observations at 700°C.  


Figure 3.5: Backscattered electron images from specimens aged at 800°C: (a) 2.4 h; (b) 2.4 h after 50% cold work; (c) 24 h after 90% cold work; (d) 24 h; (e) 24 h after 50% cold work; (f) 240 h after 90% cold work; (g) 240 h; (h) 240 h after 50% cold work; and (i) 240 h after 90% cold work.

Faster precipitation kinetics after cold work were also observed at 800°C as compared to 700°C when holding the aging time constant at 2.4 h (Figure 3.5a-c), 24 h (Figure 3.5Figure 5d-f), and 240 h (Figure 3.5f-i).  After 50% cold work Laves phase precipitates are present in the matrix and on the grain boundary (Figure 3.5 b, e, h), displaying a preferred orientation relationship with the matrix as observed in the as-aged case.  With 90% cold work (Figure 3.5 c, f, i) the microstructure more closely resembles that of the alloy with cold work at 700°C.  The Laves phase no longer appears elongated, but is globular in shape without any obvious preferred growth direction.  Also, in the samples aged at 800°C after 90% cold work on increasing the annealing time from 24 h to 240 h (Figure 3.5 f, i) it appears there is growth of both the Laves phase and B2 decorated subgrain boundaries.  While Laves phase precipitation was the main target of this study, samples with 90% cold work highlight once again how cold work influenced the precipitation process so that Laves was concurrent with NiAl precipitation.  For example, whereas it was noted that an aging treatment of 2.4 h at 800°C (Figure 3.5a) did not show significant NiAl precipitation, the same heat treatment after a 90% rolling reduction showed the matrix inundated with both NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitates (Figure 3.5c).  Without cold work, the B2 NiAl precipitates were rarely observed in the matrix except for after long aging times (Figure 3.5g).


Figure 3.6: Hardness values for samples annealed at (a) 700ºC and (b) 800°C with error bars showing standard deviation of measurements.

In Figure 3.6a the Vickers microhardness of the solutionized alloy at 700°C (~160 HV) increased with subsequent aging for 24 h and 240 h (~300 and ~367 HV respectively).  50 and 90% reductions prior to aging improved the hardness at each aging time by at least 90 HV compared to the as-aged state.  Within the 240 h aging period, the alloy only shows a hardness peak ( ~495 HV) after a 90% rolling reduction prior to aging for 24 h.  Subsequent aging to 240 h saw a slight decrease to ~471 HV. In a similar manner to the 700ºC aged samples, aging at 800ºC led to increased hardness after 50% and 90% rolling reductions prior to aging compared to the as-aged material at each time interval (Figure 3.6b).  However, for each reduction condition, there was an initial increase in hardness after 2.4 h and a subsequent decrease in hardness with further aging at 800°C.  For example, samples without cold work and those with reductions of 0%, 50%, and 90% saw hardness drop between aging at 2.4 h and 24 h.  


3.4 Discussion
The above results show that cold rolling after solutionizing, but prior to aging, produces both more rapid precipitation of the Laves phase in the matrix and causes matrix precipitation of NiAl at 700°C and 800°C and of Ni3Al at 700°C.   With aging, the Laves precipitates show a trend of initially fast growth followed by subsequent slower coarsening as observed in a 9CrW steel [71]. As observed in the work of Yamamoto et al. after creep-rupture of this alloy at 750°C [9], when this alloy is simply aged at 800°C the Laves phase is also plate-like in shape.  Samples that were simply aged without prior cold work show precipitation trends similar to those observed by Takeyama [37] of the precipitation of Laves phase on the grain boundary and within the grain for the alloy Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb after aging.  The generated Time-Temperature-Precipitation (TTP) diagram showed that after aging for 1200 hours at 800°C Laves phase particles also precipitated homogeneously in the matrix with grain boundary precipitates being larger than those in the matrix. After 24 hours at 800°C the coarsening of the C14-type phase was mostly complete, except for where the C-14-type phase was coupled with the NiAl-type B2 phase. The Fe2Nb and the NiAl phase has also shown thermal stability after 2160 h at 800°C in an Fe-20Cr-15Ni-5Al-base alloy [15] and at 2012 h in other AFA alloys [44].  The Laves phase precipitates consistently grew along only a few directions within a given grain.

Image analysis of particle size at 700°C (Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.8) and 800°C (Figure 3.9 Figures 9 and Figure 3.1010) provides insight into how aging and cold work impacted NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitate growth.  A lognormal distribution shows the best fit for most of the sample data.  At 700°C cold work induced precipitate formation of the Laves (Figure 3.7) and B2-NiAl (Figure 3.8).  These precipitates saw modest increases in size when aging from 24 to 240 hours.  This early precipitate formation would not have occurred with aging alone except at higher temperatures.  This is an effect that has been seen in alpha-iron, where cold work samples caused precipitation to occur at a much lower temperature (250°C) than in samples that had simply been aged (525°C) and was also attributed to lattice defects increasing the diffusion of the precipitate-forming element [72].   At 800°C with 0, 50% and 90% cold work both Laves and B2-NiAl precipitate sizes more than doubled when aging from 2.4 to 240 hours (Figure 3.9 and Figure 3.10).  The same was true for the NiAl except for the case of 90% cold work where the average particle size was relatively stable in going from 24 to 240 hours.  50% cold work did not increase the volume fraction of precipitates compared to the as-annealed state, while 90% cold work led to a larger volume fraction of precipitates.  In all cases, the standard deviation of the particle sizes increased with aging.   TEM images of samples aged at the shorter 2.4 h interval showed very few particles existed below the data collection range used in the SEM so volume fraction results are expected not to be significantly impacted by SEM resolution limits.

	A refined matrix that had reduced precipitate size and increased volume fraction was the desired microstructure for improved creep strength.  In all cases up to 240 h at 700°C Laves and NiAl particles did not show large increases in size and were ~30-70 nm above the upper 100 nm size limit (Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.8).  At 800°C while Laves particles initially started out in the 100 nm range, they grew to over 250 nm after aging for 240 h (Figure 3.9). NiAl particle size increased to over 300 nm with just aging and with 50% cold work.  Particle size did not increase as rapidly in going from 24h (181nm) to 240h (188 nm) after 90% cold work (Figure 3.10).   Even though particles over 100 nm were observed after 240 h, cold working the material did lead to a higher volume fraction of precipitates. Despite particle growth at 700°C and 800°C, for each aging condition samples with 90% cold work had the highest total volume fraction of Laves and NiAl precipitates (Table 3.1). 

Table 3.1: Volume fraction and standard deviations for NiAl and Laves phase particles.


The faster precipitation kinetics observed in the austenitic alloy Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al after cold work is not unusual.  For example, in as-cast FeNiMnAl alloys, β-Mn-structured particles only precipitate out after long anneals, but the high dislocation densities and large concentrations of vacancies in samples that have been mechanically milled accelerates their nucleation significantly [73].  Similarly, in 316 austenitic stainless steels, it was speculated that an acceleration of intermetallic precipitation could occur due to the speeding up of substitutional diffusion via an increased defect concentration.  Laves-phase precipitation was accelerated after cold work and it was hypothesized that it was the result of increased diffusivity of elements that made up the Laves phase [38].  Takeyama’s analysis indicated that in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb the formation of the Laves phase was controlled by Nb diffusion in the austenite [37] and it follows in this case that the introduction of cold work into the alloy increased the diffusivity of the Laves phase forming elements in the austenitic matrix.  In general, the distribution of the particles after cold work was non-uniform.  At both 700 and 800°C the alloy microstructure after cold work is not as homogeneous as for alloys that had simply been aged due to the presence of features such as deformation bands, cellular networks etc..  The precipitation structure would most likely have been more uniform after deformation had particles been present during the rolling reduction, but since the starting point was a fully-solutionized matrix, their distribution was affected by the dislocation structures that were introduced by cold work [74].  
	Both the Laves and NiAl phases are no longer elongated and are instead globular after 90% cold work followed by aging at 800°C.   The globular precipitates observed after 50% cold work at 700°C and 90% cold work at 800°C appeared to have no preferred crystallographic orientation.  A number of factors could have influenced this change in morphology.  Their shape may have been influenced by their general appearance on grain boundaries and densely packed dislocations.  Their concurrent precipitation also may have affected growth.  When Takeyama compared Fe-20Cr-35Ni-2Nb to Fe-20Cr-25Ni-2Nb the Laves phase morphology was shown to change with the c/a ratio.  It was also demonstrated that the alloy with decreased nickel content contained a Laves phase that was smaller and less elongated [37].  
The hardness for the alloy aged at 700ºC is reflective of changes brought about by aging and cold work (Figure 3.6aFigure 6a).  As Laves and NiAl particles form their constituent atoms contribute less to solution strengthening and more to precipitate strengthening. At 700°C after 50% cold work, hardness increases in conjunction with an increase in the volume fraction of both NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitates.  With 90% cold work there is increased hardness as compared to 50% cold worked samples with a peak in hardness at 24 hours, the decrease at 240 hours is most likely influenced by particle growth.  The presence of the Ni3Al particles most likely contributes to the higher hardness values seen at 700°C compared with those seen at 800°C.  At 800°C a hardness peak is not only observed after a 90% reduction, but also with a 50% reduction and by simply aging.  The higher temperature is most likely the reason behind the increased aging rate due to the aforementioned enhanced diffusion through the matrix.  At 800°C with no cold work the single hardness peak is consistent with simple nucleation and precipitate growth.  With the rise in the volume fraction of NiAl (0.3% to 2.6%) the NiAl precipitates increase by nearly a third in size (194 vs. 322 nm), which may be the cause of the decrease in hardness (Figure 3.6b).   With 90% cold work, after aging at 800ºC for 24 h a large hardness decrease is congruent with the growth of recrystallized grains (Figure 3.5c).  After 240 h (244 Hv), the recrystallization that has occurred at 800ºC results in a hardness similar to the 240 h as-aged condition (242 HV).   




3.5 Summary
Cold work resulted in the creation of a defect structure that facilitated the heterogeneous precipitation of both C14-type Fe2Nb and B2-type NiAl precipitates.   Increasing the amount of cold work caused the B2 phase to precipitate out after shorter anneals and at a lower temperature.  Both B2 and Laves phases experienced more rapid precipitation in the matrix compared to material that had not been strained prior to aging at 700ºC and 800ºC.  γ’-Ni3Al precipitates were also noted after a 90% rolling reduction prior to aging at 700ºC.   Rolling reductions of 50 and 90% followed by ageing at 700°C and a 90% rolling reduction followed by ageing at 800°C was shown to be effective in accelerating precipitation and refining the precipitates in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al.  At 700°C, cold work was effective in increasing precipitate volume fraction at each aging condition when compared to samples that were simply aged.  The change in the kinetics occurring at the higher temperature of 800°C influenced the effects of aging and cold work.  For example, hardness peaks were observed with and without cold work.  Precipitate size also generally increased.  In the case of 90% cold work, the number density of precipitates only decreases with time even though the combined precipitate number density peaked and more than tripled within a short time period as compared to simply aged samples.  Even when taking coarsening into consideration, with 90% cold work, the combined NiAl and Laves phase volume fraction increased.  The increased precipitation caused by sufficient levels of cold work resulted in increased hardness when compared to material that had been simply aged.

This chapter is largely derived from: G. Trotter, et. al., The effect of aging on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of the alumina-forming austenitic stainless steel Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 627 (2015) 270-276.
4.1 Introduction
The materials needed for energy applications have traditionally been those that maximize efficiency and decrease costs.  Alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels have shown promise to decrease reliance on expensive Ni-base alloys for aggressive conditions in energy production and chemical processing environments [17].  AFAs use alumina as a protective oxide scale for high corrosion resistance instead of chromia; alumina is known to offer even better protection than chromia at high temperatures [18, 19].  
The newer grades of AFA stainless steels have an austenitic matrix, which provides better high-temperature creep strength than a b.c.c. matrix, and either MC or γ’-Ni3Al precipitates provide creep strengthening [9, 10, 17].  AFA stainless steels, which exist over a wide compositional range, have shown promising results but further study is needed to find the optimum combination of alloying elements that provide the most effective creep strengtheners at reasonable cost for commercialization [17]. Even within particular grades of AFAs, the influence of precipitate phases on creep strength is complex and a wide variety of creep strengths can be obtained with relatively small changes in alloying elements and phases [17, 21, 24] .
Laves phase precipitates are potential candidates for strengthening AFA stainless steels.  The AB2-type Laves phase generally comes in one of three forms: hexagonal MgZn2 (C14), cubic MgCu2 (C15) or hexagonal MgNi2 (C36) [29].  Even though Laves phase has been shown to be harmful in some ferritic steels [34], decreasing their toughness and strength and  precipitating at the grain boundaries, some research has indicated their potential for strengthening in both AFA stainless steels and alloys with similar compositions [9, 15, 22-24, 35].  Use of the C14 Fe2Nb  as a strengthener in an AFA steel could be advantageous because it has a high melting temperature of 1641°C, exists in equilibrium with f.c.c. γ-Fe to temperatures above 955°C [35, 37], and has shown long-term stability at high temperatures [9, 15, 37, 44].  Some previous studies have looked to Laves phase particles for strengthening in AFA-type alloys, but have only seen low or moderate improvements in creep resistance [9, 15].  There was a slight improvement in creep resistance at 750°C and 100 MPa in an AFA steel when the niobium content increased from 1-2 at. % but the improvement was small when compared to the effect of increased carbon content.  There was some dislocation pinning by coarse 500 nm size Fe2Nb precipitates and 10 nm size MC carbide precipitates but it was not clear whether the combination of precipitates was better than strengthening by MC carbide alone [15].  
In the present work, the effects of heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of an alumina-forming austenitic stainless steel, Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) have been investigated. We show that, despite extensive intermetallic coverage of the grain boundaries, surprisingly, the material was able to show both good ductility and strength. 

4.2 Experimental
A 1250 ºC solution treatment of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) was used to produces a single phase material.  Samples were subsequently aged in air for 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h, 480 h and 1325 h at 800°C.  A FEI XL-30 field emission gun (FEG) scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated at 15 kV and equipped with EDS was used for microstructural analysis.  Samples were prepared for SEM analysis by polishing with successively finer grits of silicon carbide paper, up to 1200 and with 0.3 and 0.05 µm alumina powder in a water to obtain a mirror finish.  Backscattered electron (BSE) images from the specimens were processed using ImageJ using the routine described in the Experimental section of this thesis using Z-contrast to distinguish precipitates.

4.3 Results and Discussion
After solutionizing at 1250°C the alloy is single phase austenite (f.c.c.) and after aging at 800°C both Laves and NiAl phases are present [75].  Figure 4.1 shows XRD patterns of the evolution of C14-type Fe2Nb and B2-ordered NiAl precipitates in the austenitic matrix after a 1250°C, 24 h solution heat treatment and subsequent aging at 800°C for 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h, and 1325 h.  X-ray peaks corresponding to C14 and B2 phases were not clearly visible until 24 and 240 h, respectively.  

Figure 4.1:  XRD patterns of bulk samples of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) with visible peaks labeled (‘γ’, for the f.c.c. matrix, ‘ɛ’ for the Laves phase, ‘NiAl’ for the B2-NiAl phase) after a solution treatment and subsequent aging for 2.4, 24, 240, and 1325 h at 800°C.    
 
Figure 4.2 shows BSE images of the microstructures after the 1250°C solution heat treatment and after aging at 800°C for  0.5 h, 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h, and 1325 h;; the phase showing the light contrast is the C-14 type Fe2Nb and the darker phase is the B2-structured NiAl.  These precipitates are common in AFAs [1-7, 17, 21, 76].  Figure 4.2 (b) shows that precipitation of the Laves phase occurs on the grain boundaries even within 30 minutes at 800°C.  Figure 4.2 (c) shows that after aging for 2.4 h at 800ºC NiAl precipitation accompanies the Laves phase precipitation on the grain boundaries, however, the Laves phase precipitates make up a majority of the grain boundary precipitates and are coarser than the Laves phase precipitates in the grain interior. After aging for 24 h (Figure 4.2 (d)) the Laves and NiAl precipitates have increased in size in the matrix and the NiAl grain boundaries and the amount of NiAl on the grain boundaries is now similar to the extent of Laves phase coverage. Figure 4.2 (e) shows that at 240 h the NiAl precipitates have significantly increased in size in the matrix compared to the Laves phase, but on the grain boundaries the Laves and NiAl particles are comparable in size.  After aging for 1325 h (Figure 4.2 (e)) larger Laves phase particles are present in the matrix, and the size of the NiAl particles has also increased.  As the aging time increased, a precipitation free zone (PFZ) becomes evident on the grain boundaries and increases in size.  The formation of the precipitate free zone with longer aging is not surprising since the grain boundaries and matrix precipitates are made up of the same solute atoms [77].  In a 60 µm grain sized sample of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) that was examined after creep-rupture testing at 750ºC and 100 MPa, a γ’-PFZ was formed that was postulated to have caused low creep-ductility.  It was suggested that coarsening the grain size or using directional solidification to reduce the total grain boundary area might improve creep properties [9].

The light precipitates are the Laves phase and the dark precipitates are the B2 phase.



Table 4.1:  Average particle diameter for matrix and grain boundary Laves and NiAl precipitates for Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) aged at 800°C.


Table 4.1 shows the average Laves and NiAl particle sizes both on the grain boundaries and within the matrix at each aging condition.  The sizes of NiAl and Laves phase matrix precipitates for aging up to 240 h were reported in [75] and are duplicated in the table.  The Laves phase particles in the matrix after 24 h nearly doubled in size (205 nm) compared to the size at 2.4 h (95 nm).  The Laves phase precipitates on the grain boundaries are 192 nm after aging for 2.4 h and show continued growth up to 743 nm after 1325 h.  The NiAl particles are not visible in the matrix after 2.4 hours, but appear on the grain boundaries (126 nm) and are slightly smaller than the Laves phase grain boundary precipitates (192 nm).  Once NiAl precipitation is observed in the matrix at 24 h, the particle size continues to increase for aging times up to 1325 h: at 240 h the NiAl particle size (323 nm) is larger than that of the Laves phase (252 nm).  At 240 h the grain boundary NiAl particles (366 nm) are also larger than the Laves phase particles on the grain boundaries (252 nm) and they continue to grow at a faster rate than the Laves phase grain boundary particles for aging up to 1325 h.  After 1325 h the Laves phase particles showed growth to 301 nm in the matrix and the NiAl matrix particles had increased to 734 nm.  In a Fe-20Cr-15Ni-5Al (at. %) base alloy [15] the authors noted that after 2160 h at 800°C there was not much change in the microstructure indicating good thermal stability. This thermal stability has also been noted after 2012 h at 750°C in other AFA alloys [44].

Table 4.2:  Area fraction of grain boundary Laves and NiAl precipitates, room temperature yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and elongation to failure, f, and strain-hardening exponent, n (with two n values in the case of two-stage work hardening), calculated over the uniform plastic range as a function of aging time at 800°C for Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %).

Table 4.2 shows how the area fraction of grain boundary precipitates changes with time.  While there is no grain boundary coverage without aging, after 2.4 hours there is 56% grain boundary coverage.  There is much more variability in grain boundary coverage after aging at 2.4 h.  There is significant grain boundary coverage of 78% after 24 h and 84% after 240 h.  After 1325 h the grain boundary was almost completely saturated with 93% coverage. At the early stages of aging, the amount of grain boundary precipitation significantly varies depending on the grain boundary misorientation.  This is consistent with Denham and Silcock’s observation that the size and density of the Fe2Nb precipitates can show variations based on the crystallography of the grain boundary [78].  In the present alloy, as the grain boundary precipitates grew in size as the sample was aged, the boundaries that had less coverage initially were able to ‘catch up’ which led to  increased grain boundary coverage as the sample was aged.  

Figure 4.3 (a) is a bright- field TEM image showing dislocations surrounding the Laves phase precipitates.  Dislocations can be punched out due to the strains arising from the difference in the thermal expansion between the precipitate and matrix.  The dislocations formed from the precipitation of the Laves phase then act as sites for further Laves phase precipitation and can result in the formation of stringers [77]. Evidence of precipitation in this manner is visible in the BSE image shown in Figure 4.3 (b) where in one grain, there are lines of precipitates that have presumably precipitated on punched out dislocations. The strain contrast that is present in TEM images of Fe2Nb that has precipitated in austenite in Fe-20Cr-35Ni-2Nb and Fe-20Cr-25Ni-2Nb (at. %) after aging at 800°C [37] is indicative of a semi-coherent precipitate-matrix interface and may be a reason why the Laves phase has shown stability during aging and creep testing at 800 °C [47].  If the precipitate had a different crystal structure than the matrix it would be expected to form a needle-like or disk-like nucleus [51]. 


Figure 4.3:  (a) Bright- field TEM image showing dislocations punched out at Laves phase precipitates in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) aged for 2.4 h at 800°C; and (b) BSE image showing lines of Laves Phase precipitates in sample aged for 24 h at 800°C that have likely formed on dislocations.

Tensile testing showed that the strength and ductility of the alloy was strongly influenced by the aging time and, hence, the formation and coarsening of the precipitates.  Increasing the aging time led to an increase in tensile strength, but a decrease in ductility, (Figure 4.4).  

Figure 4.4:  Representative tensile curves of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) solutionized at 1250°C for 24 h and subsequently aged at 800°C for different times as indicated.  At least three tests were performed for each condition.

Figure 4.5 shows BSE images of the fracture surfaces after tensile testing, which all displayed dimple-type ductile rupture irrespective of the measured elongations.  The trends of decreased ductility and improved strength with ageing observed here have been noted in other AFA alloys aged at 750°C [44]. In AFA alloys with base composition Fe- (11.90-14.24)Cr -1.93Mn- (20.1025.24) Ni- (0.47-0.48) Cu- (2.87-3.91) Al- .14Si- (1.01-1.00)Nb- (2-2.01)Mo- (1-.99)W (wt. %) yield strength and ultimate tensile strength reached maximum values  (400-450 and 890-930 MPa respectively) after 50 or 500 h aging and the yield strength did not show much change, while the ultimate tensile strength slightly decreased.  Among the AFA alloys tested, elongation continuously decreased with aging regardless of composition [44].  In contrast to other heat treatment conditions, the tensile test curves after aging for 2.4 h were discontinuous and showed an upper and lower yield point with a Lder’s strain of 5%.  This yield-point phenomenon has been studied extensively in steels and is known to occur when dislocations quickly multiply and the average dislocation velocity decreases along with the stress needed to move dislocations [79-81].  A summary of the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation for each aging condition is presented in Table 4.2.  When an upper and lower yield strength was observed, the lower yield strength is presented.

Figure 4.6:  Two-stage work hardening in log-log plot of true stress versus true strain for the entire uniform plastic range for as-solutionized Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %).

Figure 4.7:  Representative log-log plots of true stress versus true strain in the uniform plastic range for Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) aged at 800°C with corresponding stress components and R2 values for (a) 2.4 h; (b) 24 h; (c) 240 h and (d) 1325 h.

Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.7 show representative plots of the strain hardening exponent fit for the different aging conditions. The n value can range from 0 to 1 with typical values being from 0.1 to 0.6 [82].  In Figure 4.7 the double logarithmic plot of the true stress and true strain for the solutionized alloy did not show a good straight line fit, while linear fits with R2 values close to 1 were obtained for aging times of 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h and 1325 h (Figure 4.7), i.e. except for the as-solutionized alloy, all the other specimens could be well described by the Hollomon equation.  Hollomon noted that there were cases where the log-log plots of stress and strain can curve upward, especially for larger strains, suggesting anisotropy [66].  The homogenized, non-aged alloy showed the largest elongation. Figure 4.6 shows that this alloy displayed two-stage work hardening also known as ‘double n’ behavior.  The curve is deconvoluted to show two stages of work-hardening with the first curve showing a small n-value of 0.18 followed by a second stage showing a high n value of 0.70.  The representative log-log plots in Figure 4.7 for samples aged at 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h and 1325 h show a good match to the Holloman equation all with R2 values of 0.99.  Samples aged at 2.4 h showed the highest work-hardening exponent with n = 0.62.  This is most likely due to the effects of discontinuous yielding. The n value for steels typically decreases with increasing strength.  The highest possible n value of a steel is when its strength is the lowest and n tends to increase with elongation [83].   In the present study, n-values after aging at 24 h, 240 h and 1325 h were ~0.3.   The strain hardening values are summarized in Table 4.2.   





Figure 4.8:  Yield strength vs. inverse interparticle spacing for Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %).
Figure 4.8 shows a linear fit to a plot of the inverse mean surface-to-surface interparticle spacing versus the yield strength, which produces the equation σy (MPa) = 74-1 +202 where  is the mean interparticle spacing.  The predicted value of the yield strength from this equation without any particles at 202 MPa is closely similar to the experimentally-measured value of 205 MPa.  The result is indicative of a looping mechanism of particle strengthening.  An Orowan looping-based mechanism would make sense for the Laves phase precipitates because they are hard and brittle and would act as a barrier to dislocation motion [44].  The model does not, however, completely capture the results obtained.  The largest YS and UTS waswere observed after 1325 h, not after 24 h when the smallest interparticle spacing was observed. 
It is possible that the greater grain boundary coverage at 1325 h is what caused the alloy to show both higher yield and tensile strength even as the matrix particles coarsened and the interparticle distance increased.   Tarigan et al. reported that creep life was extended without ductility loss even with increased Laves phase grain boundary precipitation in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at. %) [22, 23] and called the strengthening mechanism a “grain boundary precipitation strengthening mechanism” (GBPS) which they proposed was caused by decreased grain boundary deformation in sections of the grain boundary covered by the Laves phase.  In Chen et al.’s study of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-0.03B (at. %) it was also concluded that precipitation of the Laves phase on the grain boundaries enhanced creep resistance [24]. These alloys did not include additions of Al so instead of just Laves phase, both Laves and NiAl precipitates are present on the matrix and grain boundary.  Consistent with the results involving creep, the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength maximum at 1325 h in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %)  reflects the condition of maximum grain boundary coverage, indicating that the increased grain boundary precipitation acted as a more effective barrier to dislocations.  After 24 h, when over 78% of the grain boundaries were covered with precipitates, in spite of a decreased interparticle distance, the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength showed a relatively small increase up to the 1325 h aging time, compared to the initial increase in strength from the precipitation observed at 2.4 h.  The 93% grain boundary coverage at 1325 h, coupled with the more than doubling and tripling of grain boundary precipitate size at 24 h for the Laves and NiAl, respectively led ductility to decrease by ~1/3.
 Even with the grain boundaries being nearly completely saturated with precipitates of brittle phases, the alloy had ductility of 19% after 1325 h.  If the two phases are relatively coherent with the grain boundary, it would be expected that a favorable combination of creep and ductility could be attained [84].  For example, data from Keown and Pickering’s on AISI type 347 stainless steels in 1974 [85] suggested that the Fe2Nb on grain boundaries might have improved creep ductility, but Kestenbach and Bueno [84] presented evidence that disproved this.  They also cited that Fe2Nb precipitation caused decreased ductility in the high temperature tensile tests performed by Denham and Silcock [78]. However, in Bei et al.’s more recent study of AFAs, even though the ductility decreased with aging, it was still 10-15% in room temperature tensile tests after aging for 2012 h, even though there was extensive grain boundary coverage of both NiAl and Laves phases [44].  Tarigan et al. [22, 23]  observed that even with 89% grain boundary coverage by the Laves phase precipitates a creep rupture strain of 77% was attained which suggests that Laves phase grain boundary precipitates do not necessarily lead to deleterious embrittlement. The most often cited Laves phase orientation relationship with austenite achieves a 5% contraction of the matrix in the [111] direction and 9% expansion in the [112] direction [78] which represents a moderate misfit when compared to high misfit particles such as niobium carbonitride (~23% mismatch with the austenite matrix [86]) which can reduce creep ductility.  In an Fe-Ni-Cr-Al (FNCA) alloy with a similar base composition to the alloy in the present study that did not include niobium, two variants of the Kurdjmov-Sachs relationship were found for NiAl [42].  If present in this alloy, this relationship might achieve a misfit with the matrix that would encourage ductility despite extensive grain boundary precipitation. If the more oft observed orientation relationships for NiAl and Laves phases are consistent for Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %), this may explain why the coverage of the grain boundaries with these brittle precipitates might lead to sufficient ductility. 

4.4 Summary
The microstructural and mechanical response to aging Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) at 800 °C after a 1250oC solution heat treatment was studied.  With aging the Laves phase particles at first grew rapidly in the matrix and after 24 h showed steady growth to 301 nm after 1325 h. The NiAl matrix particles after 24 h were only 90 nm at the 24 h time interval and grew relatively quickly up to 734 nm after 1325 h.  Both Laves and NiAl particles grew substantially on the grain boundaries and more than doubled in size as the sample was aged from 240 to 1325 h. 

Tensile tests were performed and the strain-hardening exponent generally showed a good fit to the Holloman equation. The unaged alloy showed two-stage work hardening.  When the alloy was aged at 2.4 h an upper and lower yield point was observed.  Improved strength was observed with increased grain boundary precipitation as the sample was aged, reaching a maximum of 383 MPa at 1325 h even though the interparticle spacing decreased.  
Even as the grain boundary precipitate coverage increased to 93% after 1325 h the alloy showed room temperature elongation of 19 %.  It was hypothesized that the ductility in the alloy may be related to the low-misfits of the precipitates with the austenite matrix.

5.1 Introduction
Within particular grades of alumina-forming-austenitic stainless steels (AFAs), the influence of precipitate phases on creep strength is complex.  A wide range of creep strengths can be obtained with relatively small changes in alloying elements.  Phases that are beneficial in some AFAs cause decreased creep strength in others.  The Laves phase, for example, having shown long-term stability at high temperatures [9, 15, 37, 44], has been investigated for its ability to act as a strengthener [9, 15, 24, 76, 87].  Along with the Laves phase, the role of B2-NiAl particles in AFAs has been investigated. B2-NiAl particles have been shown to act as strengtheners in room temperature tensile tests in AFA alloys, but have not shown any strengthening effect at 750°C due to the brittle-to-ductile transition common to B2 intermetallic compounds [44]. The B2 particles support the formation of the alumina layer in AFAs by acting as an Al reservoir [44, 88].  promise
The Laves phase has an AB2 stoichiometry and can exist as three closely-related structures C14, C15, and C36.  C15 (MgCu2,  ) is the cubic form of the Laves phase, C14 is a hexagonal structure (MgZn2, P63/mmc), and C36 which is also hexagonal (MgNi2, P63/mmc).  Identification of the specific structure prevalent for an alloy system can vary with composition and heat treatment [89].  In some instances different structures are present in a given alloy [90] or one structure transforms into another [91-93].  Two crystal structures can often be present in a single particle [91, 94].  The C14-type Fe2Nb Laves phase that has been observed in studies of AFAs and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images typically has a plate-like morphology.  
The B2-NiAl phase has CsCl crystal structure, space group .  B2 particles are spherical in some materials such as precipitation-hardenable martensitic stainless steels [40] and have also shown plate-like morphology in Fe-Ni-Cr-Al (FNCA) alloys [41, 42].   There are few observations of diffraction patterns with the Laves phase being compared along with its parent matrix.  While extensive work has been done recently by Bhowmik and co-workers [95-100] and Kumar and co-workers in the past [90, 91, 101-103] in understanding Cr2Ta Laves phase structures and polymorphs, observed in Cr-Ta alloys, the Fe2Nb Laves phase has received comparatively very little attention.  As noted in [89] there are not many clear diffraction patterns in the literature depicting the Laves phase in stainless steel.  In this study, both Laves phase and B2-NiAl particles were formed from aging a solutionized, single-phase f.c.c. matrix of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al, with the objective of determining the crystallographic relation between the f.c.c. matrix and the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates via transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations. 
5.2 Experimental
      Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) was cast into 15.24 cm long, 2.54 cm diameter ingots by vacuum arc-melting followed by drop casting into a copper crucible, courtesy of Dr. Easo P. George.  After casting the alloy was homogenized for 24 h at 1250ºC.  The alloy was then aged at 800°C for up to 1325 h [18].  An FEI XL30 SEM operated at 15 kV was used to observe microstructural features. Samples for the SEM were ground using silicon carbide papers up to 1200 grit and polished to a mirror finish using 0.3 and 0.05 µm alumina powder in water.  Specimens for TEM observation were cut into rectangular bars that were milled into 3 mm diameter cylinders.  The cylinders were cut into 3 mm discs and polished to ~150 µm thick.  The thin foils were then twin jet electropolished in a solution of 25% nitric acid in methanol using a Struers Tenupol 5 at a voltage of 11 V and current of 100 mA at -20°C.  Microstructural examination of the specimens was performed using a Tecnai F20 FEG TEM operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 keV and equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).  
Experimental selected area diffraction patterns were simulated using CrystalMaker® 9.1.3 and SingleCrystal® 2.3.1 software.  The lattice parameters used to simulate SAD patterns for the matrix (a = 0.361 nm), Laves phase particles ( a = 0.482 nm, c = 0.784 nm), and NiAl particles ( a = 0.289 nm) were determined from X-ray diffraction from [18].  The value for the Laves phase is comparable to that obtained for (Fe, Cr, Ni)2(Nb, Si) Laves particles (a = 0.476 nm and c = 0.786 nm) in a Fe-15Cr-15Ni-Nb (wt.%) austenitic stainless steel that had additions of Si and other alloying elements [41]. Without 2 wt. % niobium the alloy had a matrix lattice parameter of a = 0.3549 nm, and with niobium the austenite lattice expanded to 0.3556 nm  [41].  A study of deformation behavior in an AFA steel used a similar lattice parameter of 0.361 nm for the f.c.c. matrix [20].  The Laves lattice parameter noted in this study also falls within the range found in a study of Fe-Ni-Nb, by Takeyama et. al [42] and Denham and Silcock [43].  The lattice parameter of stoichiometric B2-NiAl was reported to be 0.28864 nm [44] and the lattice parameters of Ni-(42-55)Al has been shown to fall in the range of 0.287-0.289 nm  [45].

5.3 Results and Discussion
5.3.1 Overview of Precipitates
Laves phase and B2-NiAl particles in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al typically appear to grow in distinct directions [9, 75, 87].  Figure 5.1 shows SEM backscattered electron (BSE) images of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al after both a solution treatment and a series of aging treatments at 800°C.  In Figure 5.1a the alloy shows no evidence of precipitation and is single-phase f.c.c. After aging at 800°C for 24 h Laves phase particles showing bright contrast have precipitated uniformly in the matrix with a few (dark) B2-NiAl particles present (Figure 5.1b).  Three lines are drawn on the image parallel to the long axis of the particles and a circle is drawn for the particles that appear to project out of the image.  The Laves phase particles appear to grow in only four directions.   In Figure 5.1c the BSE allows one to clearly see the larger, darker contrast B2-NiAl particles that are present at 240 h, which in some instances have grown to be much larger than the Laves phase precipitates.  In Figure 5.1d unlike at earlier times, after aging at 1325 h all NiAl particles that are visible in the matrix are much larger than the Laves phase particles in the matrix.  Four lines are drawn on the image parallel to the NiAl particles, suggesting there are at least four growth directions for the NiAl particles.  

Figure 5.1: BSE images showing Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al matrix after (a) solution treatment, and after subsequent aging at 800°C for (b) 24 h lines superimposed along the long axis of the Laves phase particles and a circle representing particles that appear to project from the image; (c) 240 h; and (d) 1325 h with lines superimposed on the images are along the long axis of the NiAl particles.

TEM-EDS results from the particles and matrix are presented in Table 5.1. The average matrix composition after aging at 800°C for 1325 h has decreased amounts of Cr, Ni, and Nb, and increased amounts of Fe, and Al as compared to the nominal alloy composition.  The B2-NiAl particles primarily consist of Ni (49.9 at. %), Al (38.1 at. %) with substantial amounts of Fe (9.2 at. %).  The values obtained for the B2-NiAl ((Ni,Fe)Al) particles are consistent with the B2-NiAl particle composition observed in a martensitic precipitation hardenable steel where atom probe data also showed a lower Al content and an incorporation of Fe while the Ni content was at 50 at. %  [104].  The Fe2Nb ((Fe, Cr, Ni)2Nb) Laves phase particles consisted primarily of Fe (40.3 at. %), Cr (14.2 at. %), Ni (15.4 at. %) and Nb (28 at. %).  Similar compositions for Fe2Nb Laves particles were observed by the author [75] and in other works [35, 54, 105, 106]. For example in a study of the alloy Fe-15Nb-40Ni (at. %) the Laves phase had a composition of Fe-27 at. % Nb-33 at. % Ni [105] and a study of Fe-16.2Cr-14.3Ni-1.2Nb (at. %) [54] described (Fe, Ni, Cr)2(Nb, Si) particles with a composition of Fe-12.6Ni-11.3Cr-22.9Nb-6.8Si (at. %), indicating a consistency in how the ‘A’ and ‘B’ elements that contribute to the AB2 Laves phase are proportioned.


Table 5.1.:  Average composition of phases observed in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al after aging at 800°C for 1325 h as determined by EDS (in at. %). The standard deviations from a minimum of five measurements each for the f.c.c. matrix, B2-NiAl particles and Laves phase are included.  




5.4 Laves phase crystal structure and orientation relationship
There are 6 fundamental four-layer stacking schemes that can be combined to form Laves phase as described by Komura [32] and 2 four-layer schemes make up the C14 structure.  The C14 phase has 12 atoms per unit cell.  The stacking of the C14 structure along the (0001) planes is similar to the …ABAB… stacking sequence observed in hcp structures [31].  There are a number of ways to describe the stacking sequence.  For example, as described by Komura [32], the 2 layers form in the close-packed direction and follow an …AB’AB’… pattern, described as: αAαcßBßc… where αAαc represents the “A” and ßBßc represents the “B’”[33].  Greek letters correspond to large atoms (Nb in Fe2Nb) and Roman letters correspond to smaller atoms (Fe). Figure 5.2a shows a C14 Laves projection onto a (0001) plane.  Depending on which atoms are chosen to occupy the corner sites of a unit cell, different descriptions of the stacking constructions can be used. For example, Chen et al. [107] describes the AB2 C14 structure with small “‘B”’ atoms making up the corners of the unit cell (Figure 5.2b) and consisting of two blocks, B1 and B1’ containing a series of primed and unprimed planes that are twin related Figure 5.2c.  Figure 5.2d shows the typical representation of a C14 unit cell.   Kumar and Hazzledine [90] have an alternate description of the C14 stacking sequence where large atoms occupy the corners of a unit cell (Figure 5.2e).  The Laves structure is described as a construction of XY’ quadruple layers which are made up of alternating triple and single layers (Figure 5.2f).  Each triple layer is ¼ of the thickness of the quadruple layer and contains 1 atom per unit cell layer.  The single layer contains 3 small atoms (Figure 5.2g).

The orientation relationship between the Laves phase particles and the matrix was investigated via tilting experiments in the TEM.  A bright-field image of a hexagonally-shaped Laves phase precipitate in the f.c.c. matrix is shown in Figure 5.3a. Figure 5.3b and Figure 5.3c show kikuchi patterns taken from the matrix and a Laves phase precipitate, respectively.  Figure 5.3d shows a selected area diffraction pattern (SADP) of the precipitate and matrix.  A schematic representation of the SADP with indexing is shown in Figure 5.3e.  The six-fold symmetry in Figure 5.3e is consistent with the basal plane of the Laves phase (hexagonal (C14), P63/mmc). The Laves phase precipitate was oriented along the [0001] direction while the matrix was at [111].  Based on the diffraction patterns, and simulated results, the orientation relationship between the Fe2Nb precipitate and the austenite matrix for this particle was confirmed to be:

(0001)Fe2Nb // (111)γ
Fe2Nb // γ

This is the relationship observed by Denham and Silcock [48] for Laves phase precipitates in an f.c.c. alloy with Fe, Cr, Ni, Nb and other minor constituents, and also in a Fe-16.2Cr-14.3Ni-1.2Nb (at. %)  alloy with minor alloying additions [54].  The Laves phase precipitate has the close-packed basal (0001) planes parallel to the close-packed (111) matrix planes that exhibit three-fold symmetry and a hexagonal pattern.  While many particles were observed with the above orientation, a number of variants were observed, which was expected from the observation of particles SEM images (Figure 5.1).

(e) Schematic representation of the orientation relationship observed in (d) with indexing.
In Figure 5.4a a TEM bright-field image of an elongated Laves particle is shown.  A SADP of the particle is shown in Figure 5.4b and the simulated matrix/Laves particle diffraction pattern is shown in Figure 5.4c.  The matrix is viewed along the [112] zone axis and the Laves phase along the This precipitate has the specific orientation of m // p, m // p.

(c) Schematic representation of the orientation relationship observed in (b) with indexing.  The solid circles represent reflections from the matrix and the hexagons represent reflections from the Laves phase.
The bright- field image in Figure 5.5a shows Laves phase/matrix orientation variants.  The Laves phase particles labeled with a “1” and a “2” are analyzed.   Laves phase particles labeled with a “(1)” or a “(2)” have the same orientation relationships of particles “1” and “2” respectively. The SADP in Figure 5.5b is taken from precipitate “1” and the SADP in Figure 5.5c is taken from precipitate “2”.  In both SADPs the f.c.c. matrix is viewed along the [101] zone axis.  Figure 5.5d and Figure 5.5e shows a representation of the superimposed electron diffraction patterns from both the matrix and the two particles with both particles being viewed along their  zone axis.  Tilting experiments and the correspondence between the image and the electron diffraction pattern of the particles, revealed that the particle whose SADP is shown in Figure 5.5b has an orientation of m // p, m // p and that shown in Figure 5.5c has an orientation of m // p, m // p. These particles grow along the matrix {111} planes ( in Figure 5.5d and  in Figure 5.5e).   The Particle shown in Figure 5.5c has the same orientation relationship as the particle presented in Figure 5.4.  Both of these particles have similar morphologies and their long axis pointing along the same direction.  


Figure 5.5:  (a) A bright- field image showing multiple variants of the Laves phase. Particles labeled with “1” and “2” are shown in the analysis.  Particles marked with “(1)” and “(2)” were found to have the same orientation relationship as “1” and “2” respectively; (b) selected area electron diffraction pattern from Laves phase particle “1” at ] and the f.c.c. matrix at  showing am // p, m // p orientation relationship; (b) selected area electron diffraction pattern from both Laves phase particle “2” and the f.c.c. matrix at [101] showing a  m // p, m // p orientation relationship; (d and e) Schematic representation of the orientation relationship observed in (b and c), respectively with indexing.  
In Figure 5.6a fourth variant of the orientation relationship between the matrix and the Laves phase is observed.  Figure 5.6a shows a TEM bright-field image with an elongated Laves phase precipitate labeled “1”.  The particle labeled “(1)” was also found to have the same orientation as particle “1”.  This precipitate is at an angle to the two other elongated Laves phase precipitates observed in Figure 5.5.  Figure 5.6b shows a diffraction pattern taken from particle “1” along the matrix [011] zone with the Laves phase precipitate at the  zone.  Figure 5.6c shows the orientation relationship m // p, m // p for particle “1” as determined through tilting experiments.  The particles were observed to grow along the matrix  plane.

The particles marked with “(1)” was found to have the same orientation relationship as “1”;  (b) SADP of Laves particle “1” phase showing a m // p, m // p variant; (c) Schematic representation of the orientation relationship observed in (b) with indexing.
In total, there were four primary variants of the Denham and Silcock orientation relationship observed in this study:

 m // p, m // p,                                               (1)
 m // p, m // p,                                               (2)
 m // p, m // p,                                               (3)
 m // p, m // p.                                               (4)

Based on the observation that for any given particle, the Laves phase {0001} close-packed planes tend to align with the {111} close-packed planes of the matrix, it can be predicted that considering symmetry, the four {111} planes in the f.c.c. matrix, and the three &lt;110&gt; directions within each {111} plane, up to 12 variants of the Laves phase and matrix orientation relationship might be observed in TEM studies (Table 5.2).  


Table 5.2:  Twelve variants of the Denham and Silcock Orientation relationship

Figure 5.7 shows the superimposed stereographic projection of the Laves phase and matrix orientations.  Since for directions of type &lt;0001&gt; and &lt;hki0&gt; plane normal and directions have the same indices, only these directions are plotted on the stereograph.  { and {} refer to prism planes of type I and type II, respectively [108].  Figure 5.7a-d shows the stereographic projections of the 4 variants described above with Laves phase (0001) traces.  The Laves phase {0001} traces overlap with the matrix {111} traces.

Particles with a hexagonal shape had the 1st orientation described above, while those that were more elongated and often plate-like and faceted are seen to grow along the other matrix {111} directions.  The calculated diffraction patterns of Figure 5.4c, Figure 5.5d and e, and Figure 5.6c, {0001} Laves and {111} matrix planes are in close proximity to one another, and taken alone, this would suggest that these planes are nearly parallel and that  &lt;111&gt; are preferred directions for precipitate growth.  This observed orientation, according to Denham and Silcock is thought to be governed by the Fe and Nb containing A-layer of the Fe2Nb (AB2) and the attainment of the same atomic site densities for the matrix and precipitate [48]. 
In their description of the Laves Fe2Nb structure, Fe atoms occupy the corner sites of the C14 unit cell.  The stacking sequence along the ‘c’ axis is described as ABAB (Figure 5.8a), and the A layer is a puckered layer that consists of Nb and Fe with the Nb atoms at , while the B layer contains Fe atoms (Figure 5.8b) [48].  The first layer of atoms that make up the basal plane of the Laves phase is coherent with the (111) matrix plane (Figure 5.8c) which results in a favorably small mismatch in lattice spacing.  In their analysis Denham and Silcock note that if a different orientation relationship occurred where the B layer of iron atoms were coherent instead, the density of atomic sites in the expanded matrix lattice would be 33% greater than in the observed orientation, which leads to the conclusion that it is the density relationship as well as well as the niobium atoms’ role in nucleation at the reaction front that are the major factors that cause the orientation that is observed.   Following the analysis in [48], given the above orientation relationship the f.c.c. matrix contracts by 6% in  the &lt;111&gt; direction and expands by 9% in the &lt;112&gt; direction and the volume expansion on transformation from matrix to precipitate is 12 %.  As noted by [109] others have successfully concluded the preferred direction of precipitate growth following this methodology, but this is not always an accurate assumption.  As predicted by the author in [87] and much like in [48] the Laves phase in the orientation relationship that has been observed was determined to have only a moderate misfit with the austenite matrix.  This may help to explain why this alloy has been shown to have room temperature ductility despite the presence of these brittle precipitates.

5.5 NiAl and matrix orientation relationship
Figure 5.9a shows a bright-field TEM image of a B2-NiAl particle.  Figure 5.9b and Figure 5.9c show a SADP taken from the NiAl particle and matrix, respectively.  In Figure 5.9b the particle is tilted to [011] and the matrix in coincident [111] in Figure 5.9c.  Figure 5.9d is a schematic of a superimposed diffraction pattern of both the particle and matrix.  From the diffraction pattern the particle was concluded to have a m // p, m // p orientation relationship, which is consistent with the Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship.  


Figure 5.9:  (a) A bright- field TEM image of a B2-NiAl particle with a typical K-S relationship; (b)  selected area diffraction pattern from the B2-NiAl particle with  zone axis; (c) selected area electron diffraction pattern from the f.c.c. matrix at ];  (d) Schematic representation with indexing of c and d for the B2-NiAl particle having an OR of  m // p,  m // p.

Figure 5.10 shows bright-field TEM images of additional B2-NiAl particles exhibiting different Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation variants determined via tilting experiments in the TEM.  In Figure 5.10a one additional NiAl particle Kurdjumov-Sachs variant is observed (to the right of the particle from Figure 5.9).  It was determined to have the orientation relationship m // p, m // p.  In Figure 5.10b two B2-NiAl particles and shown with m // p, m // p, and m // p, m // p variants of the Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship.


Figure 5.10:  TEM bright- field image showing B2-NiAl particles displaying 4 variants of the K-S orientation relationship.

Unlike with the Laves phase, NiAl particles that appeared to be oriented similarly in bright-field TEM images were observed to occasionally represent different variants of the K-S relationship.  For example, Figure 5.11 shows an analysis of two nearly side-by-side B2-NiAl particles in the matrix.  Figure 5.11a is a bright-field TEM image of the two particles in the matrix. Figure 5.11b shows a diffraction from the matrix down the [323] zone axis.  Figure 5.11c and Figure 5.11d show the diffraction patterns from the two NiAl particles while the matrix is at the [323] axis.  Figure 5.11e and Figure 5.11f show the simulated diffraction patterns of the two particles.  Though the particles appear to be oriented in the same direction based on the TEM bright- field image, their respective diffraction patterns reveal that they are two distinct twin-related variants of the K-S relationship having orientations of m // pm // p, and m // p,  m // p, respectively.

In studies of the morphology and crystallography of martensite in steels a total of 24 (V1-V24) possible variants have been predicted for the K-S relationship [110-112].  Figure 5.12 shows the superimposed stereographic projections of the matrix and B2-NiAl particles that have the K-S relationship.  {111} and {011} matrix and precipitate planes are plotted on the stereographic projections.

In this study a total of 6 of the 24 K-S variants were observed:

               	          (V1): m // p, m // p,                                  (5)
                                (V11): m // p, m // p,                                  (6)
                                (V13): m // p, m // p,                                  (7)
                    (V24): m // p, m // p.                                  (8)
                     (V7 ): m // p, m // p.                                  (9)
                                 (V8 ): m // p, m // p.                                  (10)

Others have noted K-S variants and theory suggests that the lattice parameter value plays an important role in the determination of the preferred orientation observed in f.c.c./b.c.c. systems.  The K-S orientation relationship has been seen in an Fe-Ni-Cr-Al (FNCA) alloy [41, 42] with B2-NiAl precipitates that also had a plate-like morphology.  In that case, two K-S orientation relationship variants were observed.  In a study of f.c.c. Co precipitates in a B2-ordered (Ni,Co)Al alloy [58], 3 variants of the K-S orientation relationship were observed and it was noted that the ratio of the lattice parameters of the f.c.c and b.c.c. phase can influence the orientation relationship.  In [109] it was predicted that b.c.c. and f.c.c. systems have a lattice parameter ratio between 1.21 and 1.36 would have the K-S relationship.  Given the value of 1.25 for the lattice parameter ratio between the f.c.c. matrix and the B2-NiAl in this alloy, it is not surprising that K-S orientation is observed for the NiAl precipitates. 

Conclusions
Hexagonal-shaped and elongated Fe2Nb-type Laves phase, and plate-like B2-NiAl precipitates were observed after a solution anneal at 1250°C followed by aging at 800 °C in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al.  The orientation between the f.c.c. matrix and Laves phase was determined to have the m // p, m // p orientation relationship proposed by Denham and Silcock. The B2-NiAl precipitates were determined to have a Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship with the matrix, i.e. m // p, m // p.  While the Laves phase particles primarily followed four variants, six variants of the K-S orientation were observed for the B2-NiAl particles.

7.1 Introduction
Recently, there has been a shift in focus on the development of AFAs.  AFAs have traditionally been strengthened by MC and/or M23C6 carbides [17], for example .  Ccreep resistance in an AFA was shown to improve with an increase in nanoscale MC precipitates [7, 10].  New studies of AFAs have shown that nano-scale γ’ –Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates can be used to improve creep [21].  Earlier studies of AFAs have noted the presence of L12 precipitates [17, 75], and nNew studies of AFAs have shown that nano-scale γ’ –Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates can be used to improve creep [21].  .  The present study uses SEM, XRD, TEM, and atom probe tomography (APT) to investigate the microstructural evolution of precipitates while aging in DAFA26 (also known as ‘32Z’ based on a Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-0.15Si-(3-4)Al-(1-3)Ti-(0-0.3)Zr wt. % alloy with or without C and B, where the ‘32’ refers to 3#Al-21Ti with Zr addition) [21].
7.2 Experimental
Samples of DAFA26 were obtained from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  600 g ingots were arc-melted using pure element feedstock.  The arc-melted ingots were then drop cast into a 1” x 1” x 3” bar shape die, soaked for 2 hours at 1100°C in Ar + 4% H2 gas and then hot-rolled along the longitudinal axis with an approximately 15-20% thickness reduction per pass until the desired thickness reduction (up to 80%) was achieved.  The same homogenization temperature of 1100°C was then used to solutionize the plate for 30 minutes in Ar + 4% H2 gas, followed by air cooling.  Table 6.1 includes both the nominal composition and analyzed composition of DAFA26.

 Table 0.1: DAFA26 alloy composition (nominal and analyzed)

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on DAFA26 samples and MDI Jade software was used to identify phases in the alloys and to analyze the diffraction patterns.
Vickers hardness of DAFA26 after different heat treatments was determined using a TIME TH-713 Microhardness Tester under a load of 1.96 N (200 g) with a 15 second dwell time.  
TEM, SEM, and APT analysis of the DAFA26 was also performed.  TEM thin-foils were observed in an EDS-equipped FEI Tecnai FS20ST FEG TEM operated at 200 kV.  The resulting TEM samples were also observed in a FEI XL30 filed emission gun (FEG) scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated at 15 kV.  Atom probe tomography (APT) analysis was performed at Oak Ridge National Lab using a Cameca instruments local electrode atom probe (LEAP).  Specimens were annularly milled in an FEI Nova 200 dual beam FIB-SEM after being electropolished in a solution of 2% perchorlic acid and 98% 2-butoxyethanol.  Some samples were also fabricated by annular milling and a lift-out procedure [63].  



7.3 Results and Discussion
Figure 6.1 shows XRD patterns of the DAFA26 in the as-hot-rolled state and after 2, 72, 720, and 3000 h of aging at 750°C with f.c.c., B2, L12, and Laves phase peaks labeled.  The diffraction patterns for each condition are nearly identical.  F.c.c. and C14 Laves phase peaks are of similar intensities throughout the aging sequence, while the L12 and B2 peaks become more prominent as the aging time increases.  Whole pattern fitting of the diffraction pattern yielded lattice parameters for the specimens annealed for 3000 h.  The lattice parameter of the f.c.c. matrix was estimated to be a = 0.3602 nm and that for the γ’-L12 phase a = 0.3595 nm.  The lattice parameter of the B2-NiAl was a = 0.2892 nm and those for the C14 Fe2Nb Laves phase, a = 0.4823 nm and c = 0.7865 nm.  DAFA29 is a stainless steel that has a similar nominal composition to the DAFA26 sample with an addition of 0.1 wt. % C and 0.01 wt. % B.  The lattice parameter estimates for the γ’, f.c.c. matrix, and B2-NiAl are similar to the synchrotron XRD measured values for DAFA29 after being aged for 240 hours (γ’, a = 0.3599 nm, f.c.c., a = 0.3609 nm, B2-NiAl a = 0.2892 nm) [113].   The as-processed DAFA26 samples had a grain size of 20 µm and showed a small amount of grain growth to 28 µm after aging for 3000 h.





Figure 0.1:  XRD pattern of bulk DAFA26 samples with visible peaks labeled ‘γ’’ for the L12 particles, ‘B2’ for NiAl, and ‘ɛ’ for the Laves phase in the as-cast state and after aging at 2, 72, 720, and 3000 h).

Hardness measurements of DAFA26 were taken after being aged at 750°C for 0, 1, 2, 8, 24, 72, 168, 720 and 3000 hours. Figure 6.2 shows the Vickers hardness of the alloy when aged up to 3000 hours.  The as-processed alloy showed a hardness of 294 ± 20 HV.  As DAFA26 is aged, its hardness continuously increases, reaching a peak hardness of 486 ± 39 HV after 24 hours of aging.  The hardness of the alloy then continues to decrease, reaching 387 ± 11 HV.

 	The microstructure of DAFA26 after aging is shown in Figure 6.3.  A number of microstructural changes can be observed.  The DAFA sample as-processed (Figure 6.3a) has Laves phase precipitates that appear to beare aligned along the hot rolling direction.  The Laves phase precipitates in the DAFA26 microstructure look similar to the Laves phase precipitation in a Fe-25%Al-3%Nb alloy that was forged at 1150°C [114].  The lower homogenization temperature appears to lead to an increased size of the Laves phase on the grain boundaries.  Yamamoto et. al also noted that compared to AFA samples homogenized at or above 1200°C the DAFA26 sample homogenized at 1100°C had very coarse Laves phase precipitates on the grain boundaries [21].  After aging for 2 h (Figure 6.3b) the sample has additional grain boundary coverage of alternating Laves and NiAl particles.  This alternating grain boundary pattern was present in small amounts in the as-processed condition, and is often more easily observed in micrographs of AFAs that have been exposed to prolonged aging at high temperature.  The grain boundary coverage increases as the sample is aged up to 3000 h (Figure 6.3c-e).

Figure 6.4 shows the grain boundaries and matrix of the DAFA26 at higher magnification as it is aged.  Figure 6.4a-c are SEM-BSE images and Figure 6.4d is a SEM-SE image.  In Figure 6.4a showing the as-processed DAFA26, there is very little grain boundary precipitation apart from large Laves phase precipitates.  As the sample is aged up to 720 h (Figure 6.4c) more grain boundary precipitation is evident and the alternating NiAl and Laves phase precipitates are visible.  This alternating precipitation is  similar to what has been seen in previous studies observing  the study of the evolution of precipitation of grain boundary precipitation in AFA-type alloys.   It is most likely that the grain boundary is able to include both coarse Laves phase particles and the alternating NiAl and Laves phase particles because DAFA26’s 1100°C homogenization temperature was not high enough to suppress the growth of coarse Laves phase precipitates on the grain boundary.  For example, Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) which was homogenized at 1250°C [75, 87, 115] and AFA alloy “41Z” studied by Yamamoto et. al, which was homogenized at 1200°C had no coarse Laves phase on the grain boundaries.    TheIn Figure 6.4d the SEM-SE image more clearly shows topographic contrast and the presence of the L12 precipitates. There are not only alternating Laves-NiAl particles on the grain boundaries, but tThere are also B2-NiAl particles that appear to have grown from the larger Laves phase particles that were initiallyhad been present in the matrix before aging.
the ~2 µm Laves particles that were present within grains in the as-processed condition show NiAl particle growth (Figure 0.3e and Figure 6.4d).  In addition to notable changes in the grain boundary precipitation, Figure 6.4c and d SEM images shows the presence of the the spherical L12 particles whose (110) peak was only strong enough to be observed in the in XRD pattern after the sample had been aged for 3000 h results (Figure 0.1).  The particles are visible in the SEM images after aging for 720 h (Figure 6.4c) and have grown noticeably in size after aging at 3000 h (Figure 6.4d).  There are also B2-NiAl particles that appear to have grown from the larger Laves phase particles that were initially present in the matrix before aging.



Figure 0.4: SEM images of DAFA26 samples grain boundaries: (a) as-processed, and aged at 750°C for  (b) 2 h; (c) 720 h;  and (d) 3000 h. 

The size of the Laves phase particles that are present in the as-processed state and up to 3000 h is stable at ~ 2µm. The volume fraction of these particles is relatively stable as well and is ~5-6% up to 720 h and peaked at ~8% after 3000 h.  Growth of additional Laves phase on the grain boundary had a modest impact on the overall volume fraction of the Laves phase (i.e. at 3000 h volume fraction was calculated at 7.60% only including Laves phase particles that were present beginning in the as-processed state and just 8.47% when the additional growth of the Laves phase grain boundary precipitates is included).  

TEM analysis shows the morphology and size of the L12 γ’-Ni3Al precipitates present in DAFA26 samples that have been aged.   In a TEM bright- field image of the sample after 72 h of aging, the L12 γ’-Ni3Al precipitates are shown to be spherical (Figure 6.5).  Figure 6.5b shows a selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern taken from the matrix [001] zone axis.  Two sets of diffraction spots are visible in the diffraction pattern.  The brighter spots belong to the f.c.c. matrix phase, and the weaker diffraction spots represent the L12 γ’-Ni3Al superlattice reflections.  The γ/γ’ microstructure observed in DAFA26 is common in Ni-based superalloys [45].  Analogous to the analysis of the similarly composed DAFA29 stainless steel [113] and other alloys that have been strengthened by L12 γ’-Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates [21] the orientation relationship between the L12 phase and the f.c.c. matrix in DAFA26 is cube-on-cube (i.e. (m // p, m // p).


Figure 0.5: DAFA26 aged at 72 h at 750°C.  (a) A BFbright-field TEM image; (b) SAD down the [001] γ-matrix zone axis with weak superlattice reflections from L12-γ’ precipitates.

As the sample is further aged for 720 h and 3000 h the L12-γ’ precipitates further increase in size (Figure 6.6).  TEM-EDS results show the composition of Laves and NiAl particles that have formed on grain boundaries (Figure 6.7). The Laves phase grain boundary particles show high Fe (45.6 at. %), Cr (10.5 at. %), Ni (14.8 at. %) and Nb content (18.1 at. %) and the NiAl particles have high Ni (46.1 at. %), Fe (9.7 at. %) and Al (38.9 at. %) content.  The composition trends are similar to what was reported for Al and Nb-rich precipitates in a Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) sample that had been solutionized, cold-worked to 50% and aged at 240 h at 800°C.  For example, in the NiAl particle, while the Fe content is smaller (9.7 versus 25.1 at. %), the approximately 1:1 atomic ratio of Ni to Fe and Al is maintained [75].

	Figure 6.8 shows a bright- field TEM image of the L12 particles after aging for 3000 h at 750°C.  Even after aging at 3000 h the γ’-precipitates remain spherical.   The L12 precipitates are nearly twice as large as compared to the sample aged for 720 h at 750°C (Figure 0.6).

Figure 0.8:  A bright-fieldBF TEM image of DAFA26 after aging at 750°C for 3,000 h.  

In addition to TEM analysis, DAFA26 samples were observed using APT.  

Figure 6.9 shows a three-dimensional reconstruction of the as-hot-rolled DAFA26 alloy.  Only Al (green) and Ni (mauve) atoms are displayed in the γ’ precipitates, enabling the 3D identification of the Ni3Al precipitates.  L12 particles were observed in the as-processed DAFA26 samples.  γ' precipitates were uniformly and randomly distributed throughout the DAFA26 matrix.  The γ/γ’ microstructure observed in DAFA26 is common in Ni-based superalloys [45].




Figure 0.9: APT three-dimensional reconstruction of the as-hot-rolled DAFA26 alloy.  The mauve is the Fe in the f.c.c. matrix, while the green points indicate Ni in the Ni3Al precipitates. 
Figure 6.10 shows a proximity histogram across the γ-f.c.c. and γ’-L12 phases, revealing elemental partitioning between the phases.  Ni (66 at. %), Al (14 at. %), and Ti (10 at. %) are the major elements present in the γ’-L12 phase.  Ti additions are thought to stabilize the L12 phase, however the addition of Ti tends to lower the oxidation resistance of AFAs [21].  Much like in thea Fe-25%Al-3%Nb alloy [114], only ~1% Nb was detected in the matrix. 


Figure 0.10:  Proximity histogram across the γ-f.c.c. matrix and a γ’-L12 phase particle in the as-processed DAFA26.  The iron and nickel-rich DAFA26 matrix is on the negative side of the distance scale and the γ’-L12 phase particle is on the positive side.

After DAFA26 is aged at 750°C for 2 hours (Figure 6.11) the γ’ particles show considerable growth as compared to the as-processed state (Figure 0.9).  The proximity histogram (Figure 6.12) reveals that the Ni content of the γ’ phase has increased from 66 at. % in the as-aged condition to 71 at. % after 2 hours of aging while, Al (14 at. %) showed little change from the as-processed condition, and the Ti content has decreased from 10 at. % in the as-processed condition to 8 at. % after aging for 2 hours.

After aging up to 72 and 720 h it appears that the particle composition is relatively stable with a slight decrease noted in Fe (7.9 at. % to 9.3 at. %) and Ni (69.4 at.% to 66.7 at. %) (Figure 6.13).

The evolution of the size of the L12 particles is shown in Figure 6.14.  The average particle diameter is plotted against the cube-root of time, with error bars indicating the standard deviation.  The particle sizes were approximated from LEAP data and TEM micrographs. In the as-processed state the L12 particles are ~ 4 nm in diameter and they increase to ~9 nm after being aged at 750°C for 2 h.  The particle size nearly doubles again as the sample is aged up to 72 h (19 nm).  After aging at 720 and 3000 h the particles increase from 52 to 90 nm, respectively.  The average length scale of particles initially changes rapidly and then slows down.  A linear relationship between the particle size and the cube-root of time was determined which satisfies the predictions of the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory for volume diffusion-controlled growth processes [116, 117].  Creep testing this alloy at 750°C appears to have little impact on the size evolution of L12 precipitates. The L12 precipitate size values are similar to what has been reported for this alloy after 952 h creep testing (71 nm) and in a similar alloythe DAFA29 alloy (DAFA26 with additions of C and B) after 3,008 h of testing (95 nm) [21].


Figure 0.14.: Plot of the average L12 particle size versus the cube-root of the aging time for DAFA26 aged at 750°C.

In addition to L12 particle composition, trends in the evolution of the matrix composition were also revealed using APT results.  For example, based on APT data, as the sample is aged up to 720 h the amount of Fe in the matrix increases from ~42 at. % to ~56 at. %, while decreases are observed for Ni (~33 to 20 at. %,), Al (~7 to 3 at. %), and Ti (~3 to 0.4 at. %).  The decrease in Ni, Al, and Ti can be explained by the growth of the L12 precipitates as well as the growth of NiAl particles on the grain boundaries.  Keeping in mind that the analyzed amount of Cr in the as-processed DAFA26 is 14.8 at. %, the increase in Cr to 19 at. % after 720 h would be expected because Cr is a minor component of all the precipitate phases found in the matrix.


Based on the analysis of the precipitate and matrix evolution, it is unlikely that the presence of the Laves phase has much impact on room-temperature strength of DAFA26.  The increase in hardness that is observed up to 24 h (~ 484 HV) and the subsequent decrease to ~387 HV after aging at 3000 h is a result of phase coarsening.  Since the relative size and volume fraction of the Laves phase precipitates is stable, the presence of L12 Ni3(Al, Ti) precipitates influenced the hardness.  At peak hardness, the size of the L12 particles is between 9-19 nm.

7.4 Summary
1.	The microstructure of DAFA26 consists of C14 Fe2Nb Laves phase particles, B2-NiAl particles, and L12 Ni3(Al,Ti) particles.
2.	Laves phase particles are present both in the matrix and on the grain boundaries in the as-processed state up to 3000 h aging.  These particles were initially only along the rolling direction and throughout the aging the average particle size of these particles was stable at ~2 µm.  As the sample is aged, nucleation and growth of additional Laves phase particles occurs on the grain boundaries. These alternate with NiAl particles along the grain boundaries.  In addition, there is growth of NiAl on the Laves particles that were initially present in the as-processed case.
3.	APT and TEM analysis provided compositional data which shows the matrix being depleted of Ni, Al, and Ti due to the growth of Ni3Al.  Despite long-term aging up to 3000 h, the Ni3Al particles remain spherical.  The kinetics of Ni3Al precipitation shows good agreement with the LSW theory, with a particle diameter length scale showing t1/3 growth.  These precipitates have a cube-on-cube orientation relationship with the matrix (i.e. (m // p, m // p).
4.	Since the Laves phase particles are stable and only the L12 precipitates show changes in size along with aging, the hardness data suggests that it is the L12 precipitates and not the Laves phase particles that have the most impact on room temperature strength as the sample is aged.

8.1 Conclusions
8.1.1 Microstructural changes due to cold work of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al 
1.	Upon aging Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) at 700 and 800°C, C14-Laves phase and B2-NiAl particles precipitate in an austenitic matrix.  With 90% cold-work and aging at 700°C the sample also forms L12 particles.
2.	Cold rolling prior to aging results in the creation of a heterogeneous defect structure within the matrix and facilitates the heterogeneous nucleation of both C14 Fe2Nb and B2-NiAl precipitates.
3.	At 700°C, cold work is effective in increasing precipitate volume fraction at each aging condition when compared to samples that are simply aged.
4.	The change in the kinetics occurring at the higher temperature of 800°C influences the effects of aging and cold work. Compared to material that had not been strained, defects introduced by cold work not only cause more rapid precipitation in the matrix but also increases the total volume fraction of precipitates as compared to material that had been simply aged.

8.1.2 Mechanical behavior of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %)
1.	Precipitation in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb has an important effect on the material’s mechanical properties; an increase in precipitate growth was accompanied by an increase in strength.  Upon aging at 800°C, the Laves phase rapidly precipitates on the grain boundaries and these precipitates are coarser than those found within the matrix.  The Laves phase particle size is relatively stable as the sample is aged and they are initially larger than NiAl precipitates. The NiAl particles initially show slow growth but eventually that growth increases and the NiAl particles overtake the Laves phase particle size and become more than double their size. 
2.	Unlike within the matrix, on the grain boundary after aging for 1335 h, there is a much smaller size difference between the Laves phase and NiAl particles show a much smaller difference in size.  Despite nearly complete coverage of  the grain boundary by the two brittle phases the alloy still shows room-temperature ductility. 
3.	The alloy showed a fairly large increase in room-temperature yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) that was tied to the precipitation and growth of particles in the matrix. The strain-hardening exponent of the alloy was determined and generally showed a good fit to the Holloman equation. 

8.1.3  Analysis of orientation relationships between matrix and Laves and NiAl particles
1.	The orientation between the f.c.c. matrix and Laves phase was determined to have the m // p, m // p orientation relationship proposed by Denham and Silcock.  
2.	The B2-NiAl precipitates were determined to have a Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship with the matrix, i.e. m // p, m // p. 
3.	Despite the presence of Laves phase and B2 NiAl precipitates in AFAs and other austenitic stainless steels, the orientation relationship between the Laves phase and the matrix is such that there is only a moderate misfit between the two, which helps to explain why these alloys can still remain ductile despite the presence of brittle phases.

8.1.4  Effect of Aging on the Microstructural Evolution of L12 γ’-precipitates
1.	AFA DAFA26 aged at 750°C was observed hasto have B2-NiAl, C14-Fe2Nb, and L12-Ni3(Al,Ti) particles in an f.c.c. matrix.
2.	Annealing the sample increases the amount of grain boundary precipitation present.  While at first, the grain boundaries solely consisted of large Fe2Nb particles, with aging a pattern of alternating Fe2Nb and NiAl particles appeared which is typical of the grain boundary evolution in a number of AFAs.  In addition, there is growth of NiAl particles on the Laves phase particles present in the matrix.
3.	The presence of Laves phase particles does not influence the room temperature hardness of DAFA26.  Instead, the hardness is influenced by the L12 precipitates.  These L12 precipitates have a cube-on-cube (m // p, m // p) orientation relationship with the matrix.

8.2 Suggestions for future work
8.2.1 Effect of Si
The addition of silicon to steels has been shown to promote the formation of Laves phase in a number of alloys.  The effect of the addition of 0.2 at. % Si to Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) should be determined.  The following work should be performed: 
1.	Microstructural characterization of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) and Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al-0.2Si (at. %) after solutionizing at 1250°C and aging at different times and temperatures.
2.	Hardness and tensile tests should be performed on both alloys at room temperature as well as at high temperature at different strain rates to determine and compare mechanical properties.
3.	Post-mortem and in-situ TEM should be used to investigate the effect of Si on the mechanical properties of both alloys.

8.2.2 Comparative analysis of Fe2Nb and NiAl precipitation amongst different AFAs
Investigation of Fe-14Cr-25Ni-2.5Nb-0.1Si-3.6Al (wt. %) compared to Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) should be performed in order to better understand the precipitation of the B2-NiAl and Laves phases.  The following work should be performed:   
1.	The microstructural evolution of Fe-14Cr-25Ni-2.5Nb-0.1Si-3.6Al (wt. %) with aging at different temperatures should be studied.
2.	High temperature heating of both materials should be done in the TEM.  Now that precipitate-matrix orientation relationships have been determined for B2 and Laves phase precipitates, optimal conditions in the TEM might be obtained to provide experimental observations that will better elucidate the precipitation processes in these alloys. 
3.	Room-temperature straining tests should be performed in the SEM for both alloys to better understand the role of the grain boundary and how it affects room-temperature ductility.

HU, G. TROTTER, IAN BAKER, M.K. MILLER, L. YAO, S. CHEN, and Z. CAIIn order to achieve energy conversion efficiencies of&gt;50 pct for steam turbines/boilers in power generation systems, materials are required that are both strong and corrosion-resistant at &gt;973 K (700 °C), and economically viable. Austenitic steels strengthened with Laves phase, NiAl and Ni3Al precipitates, and alloyed with aluminum to improve oxidation resistance, are potential candidate materials for these applications. The microstructure and microchemistry of recently developed alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Different thermo-mechanical treatments were performed on these steels to improve their mechanical performance. These reduced the grain size significantly to the nanoscale (~100 nm) and the room temperature yield strength to above 1000 MPa. A solutionizing anneal at 1473 K (1200 °C) was found to be effective for uniformly redistributing the Laves phase precipitates that form upon casting.DOI: 10.1007/s11661-015-2981-6Ó The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society and ASM International 2015￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼I. INTRODUCTIONTHE energy efficiency of fossil fuel-fired boiler/steam turbine power plants is strongly dependent on the operating temperature and pressure. Hence, it is benefi- cial to run such power plants at higher temperatures and pressures to enhance efficiency and reduce CO2 emis- sions. A key aspect for achieving this goal is the materials that are used for construction of the boilers and steam turbines.[1–3] Thus, extensive efforts are underway to develop affordable materials with the necessary strength, oxidation resistance, and corrosion resistance for oper- ation at temperature greater than 973 K (700 °C).[4–6] High-nickel alloys and nickel-based superalloys meet all the performance goals, but are too expensive.[7–9]Face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) austenitic stainless steels are potential materials for this high temperature appli- cation. They have a combination of good high-temper- ature creep strength and oxidation resistance with a relatively low cost.[3,10] To that end, a family of inexpensive, high creep strength, alumina-forming aus- tenitic (AFA) stainless steels has recently been devel- oped.[3,11–21] The development is based on the discoveryB.

They also show much better oxidationresistance compared to chromia-forming A286 at1073 K (800 °C) in air containing 10 pct water vapor.[20]These recently developed alloys are based on Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-3Al-2Ti (wt pct) with various minor, butimportant, elemental additions. The addition of Nb isimportant to improve the stability of alumina scale athigh temperature, and results in the formation of Fe Nb[20] 2 The addition of Ti enhances the stabilityLaves phase.of Ni3(Al, Ti) phase in AFA alloys.[20]In addition to Fe2Nb Laves phase and L12 (ordered f.c.c.) Ni3Al-type phase precipitates, a B2 (ordered b.c.c.) NiAl phase and MC carbides are observed in these AFA stainless steels.[22] The volume fractions of these phases depend on the alloy composition, mainly the Al and Nb contents. The addition of Nb is necessary to enhance the stability of the alumina scale formed at high temperature, and results in the formation of the C14 Fe2Nb Laves phase.[3,13,16,20] The Fe2Nb precipi- tates, which are stable up to 1900 K (1627 °C), are expected to be in equilibrium with both NbC and the f.c.c. iron matrix.[12,15] After an aging treatment at 1023 K (750 °C), NiAl type B2 phase precipitates can also be observed, although these have been reported to be ineffective for improving the yield strength of austenitic stainless steels above 673 K (400 °C).[5,18] However, they may enhance the creep resistance by affecting dislocation climb. Creep testing at 1023 K (750 °C) results in a finer and denser distribution of￼￼
these secondary precipitates than in alloys that have simply been aged at the same temperature. Such fine- scale second-phase precipitates may be effective in further increasing the creep strength.[22] The NiAl B2 phase precipitates also play an important role in the oxidation resistance since they act as an Al reservoir for forming an alumina scale at high temperatures.[23]As both Fe2Nb and NiAl precipitates demonstrate limited effects on the high-temperature strength at or above 923 K (650 °C),[20] the development of the AFA stainless steels has focused on introducing fine coherent precipitates such as L12-type precipitates.[20,22] Coherent Ni3Al precipitates are effective for improving the high- temperature mechanical properties in various nickel- and iron-based superalloys. One example is the iron- based superalloy A286, which shows good creep prop- erties due to the formation of coherent L12 Ni3Ti precipitates at ~1003 K (730 °C). However, the strengthening effect of Ni3Ti is limited because it is metastable at higher temperatures.[24,25] Coherent Ni3Al precipitates in AFA stainless steels[14] have been opti- mized to maximize their stability to improve creep performance.[20]Cold work with 10 pct thickness reduction can also be effective for improving the creep properties of these AFA stainless steels[22,26–28] with the dislocations intro- duced during cold rolling acting as nucleation sites for MC (NbC) carbide precipitates, resulting in doubled creep lives at 1023 K (750 °C).[12,15]The current study investigated the effect of severe cold work with 90 pct thickness reduction on the microstruc- ture and mechanical properties of recently developed AFA stainless steels, specifically the Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb- 3Al-2Ti wt pct-based AFA alloys. Detailed microstruc- tural analysis was performed on the samples before and after thermo-mechanical treatments.II. EXPERIMENTALThe AFA stainless steels used in this study were obtained from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Ingots of the alloys had been hot-rolled at 1373 K (1100 °C) (80 pct thickness reduction with ~15 to 20 pct thickness reduction per pass) and then annealed at 1373 K (1100 °C) for 30 minutes in Ar +4 pct H2 gas, followed by air-cooling. The nominal and analyzed chemistry of the AFA stainless steel, referred to as DAFA29, are given in Table I. The chemical composition of these two alloys was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and gas com- bustion techniques at ORNL.[29]The microstructures of the specimens before and after thermo-mechanical processing were examined by scan-ning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD).For examination in the SEM, samples were polished using increasingly fine grades of silicon carbide papers and then further polished using 0.3 lm alumina powders to obtain a mirror finish. The polished samples were etched using 4 pct nitric acid for 5 seconds followed by rinsing in water. The specimens were then examined in an FEI XL-30 field emission gun (FEG) SEM operated at 15 keV.Thin foils for TEM examination were produced from 3-mm dia., 200-lm-thick disks by twin-jet electropol- ishing at 11 V and ~200 mA in a solution of 25 pct nitric acid in methanol at 253 K ( 20 °C) using a Struers Tenupol 5. The resulting thin foils were examined with an FEI Tecnai F20 FEG TEM operated at 200 kV and equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).Thin foil specimens were polished from 200 lm thick disks to a thickness of 20 lm for synchrotron XRD measurements. The XRD experiments were performed at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory, with the X-ray microdiffraction facility at undulator beamline 2-ID-D.[30] X-ray photons with energy of 18 keV (wavelength = 0.688 nm) were selected using a Si h111i double-crystal monochromator, and then focused to a circular spot of ~400 nm through a Fresnel zone plate. The diffraction signals were collected with a Rayonix Mar165 CCD detector, with 2048 9 2048 pixels and 80 micron pixel size, located ~58 mm downstream of the sample. The total counting time was 55 seconds. Over this counting period, the sample was continuously rotated around an axis per- pendicular to the incident beam by 110 deg.Two thermo-mechanical treatments of the AFA stainless steel DAFA29 were performed. A detailed flowchart of these two thermo-mechanical treatments is shown in Figure 1. In Method #1, DAFA29 was cold rolled to a 90 pct reduction in thickness with a ~4.5 pct reduction per pass and then heat-thermal treated at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4, 24, or 240 hours. In Method #2, the alloy is given a solutionizing anneal at 1473 K (1200 °C) and then cold rolled to a 90 pct reduction in thickness with a ~4.5 pct reduction per pass before annealing at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4, 24, or 240 hours.After thermo-mechanical processing, room tempera- ture tensile tests were performed with a Hydraulic MTS testing machine. A preload force of 100 N was applied before the tensile tests were started. The initial strain rate for all tensile tests was 5 9 10 4 s 1. The tensile test specimens are dog-bone geometry with a gage length of 10 mm. They were polished using 800 grit silicon carbide papers and finished with 0.3 lm alumina powders to aTable I.

The elongations were measured directly from the specimens after the tensile tests.In order to compare the simple annealed samples (without cold rolling) to thermo-mechanical-treated DAFA29, another two group of DAFA29 alloys were annealed as control samples. The first group (Method #1 control) samples were annealed at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4, 24, or 240 hours. The second group (Method #2 control) samples were annealed at 1473 K (1200 °C) and then post annealed at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4, 24, or 240 hours. The room temperature tensile tests of these two groups of control samples were also performed under the same test conditions.III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA. As-received MicrostructuresA backscattered electron (BSE) image of the as- received DAFA29 showing the grain structure and the precipitates is shown in Figure 2(a). EDS data acquiredfrom the precipitates and the matrix are shown in Figures 2(b) and (c), respectively. The white precipitates are niobium enriched consistent with a Fe2Nb Laves phase. The Laves phase precipitates are aligned along the rolling direction, as shown in Figure 2(a) (white arrow). They are observed both on the grain boundary as well as in the interior of the grains. The size of these Laves phase is in the range 0.5 to 10 lm. Previous research suggested that the strengthening effect of Laves phase strongly depends on its size and distribution.[14] It has been predicted that better creep resistance could be obtained with further refinement and stabilization of the Fe2Nb particle sizes to ~100 nm.[14] MC carbides (M: Nb, Ti) are also observed in DAFA29. These precipi- tates are randomly distributed in the matrix with a size of ~5 lm. They normally have a blocky morphology. The predicted volume fraction of this phase is around 1 pct based on JMatPro simulation.A bright field (BF) TEM image of a precipitate in DAFA29 located on the edge of a thin foil is shown in Figure 3(a). A selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern taken from the f.c.c. matrix (lower circle in Figure 3(a)) is shown in Figure 3(b). The diffraction pattern consists of two sets of different diffraction spots, which are superimposed diffraction patterns from the L12 phase and the f.c.c. matrix. The weak diffraction spots are superlattice reflections from the L12 phase, whereas the strong diffraction spots are from both the fundamental reflections from an L12 phase and the f.c.c. matrix. The orientation relationship between the L12 phase and the f.c.c. matrix is cube-on-cube. The superlattice reflection is similar to the diffraction spots observed in previous studies on similar alloys strengthened by nanoscale coherent L12-ordered intermetallic c¢-Ni3(Al, Ti) pre- cipitates.[20] A convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) pattern from the large precipitate viewed along [0001] (after tilting) is shown in Figure 3(c). It shows a hexagonal pattern. Based on this result and previous￼Fig. 1—Flowchart of the two thermo-mechanical treatment methods used on DAFA 29.￼Fig. 2—The BSE image (a) of the as-received DAFA29, and EDS from (b) and (c) niobium-enriched precipitates, and (d) the matrix.

Microstructures of Thermo-mechanically Processed DAFA29In order to produce fine and uniformly distributed Laves phase precipitates, two thermo-mechanical treat- ments were used to process DAFA29, as shown in Figure 1. Previous research reported that cold rolling (with 10 pct thickness reduction) of precipitate-strength- ened austenitic stainless steels could improve creep properties, because the dislocations introduced by cold rolling acted as nucleation sites for fine MC (NbC)carbide precipitates, resulting in enhanced creep resis- tance.[12,27,28] It should be noted that the alloys exam- ined here (DAFA29) can be cold rolled to more than 90 pct thickness reduction, indicating that the coarse second-phase precipitates do not degrade room temper- ature workability of the AFA alloys, similar to the results previously reported in Reference 22.BSE images of DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1 are shown in Figure 4. The steel was cold rolled to a 90 pct reduction in thickness, after which it is evident that the large Laves phase precipitates had fractured (Figure 4(b), inset). These samples were then annealed at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4 hours (Figure 4(c)), 24 hours (Figure 4(d)), or 240 hoursMETALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A
￼Fig. 5—BSE images of DAFA29: (a) as received, (b) after a solutionizing anneal of 50 h at 1473 K (1200 °C), (c) after a subsequent 90 pct cold rolling reduction, and (c) after solutionizing, cold rolling, and annealing at 1073 K (800 °C) for (d) 2.4 h, (e) 24 h, or (f) 240 h.(Figure 4(e)). The cold rolling fractured many of the Laves phase precipitates in the matrix resulting in smaller precipitates (Figures 4(c) through (e)).BSE images of DAFA 29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #2 are shown in Figure 5. The aim of using this method is to solutionize the large Laves phase precipitates before cold rolling. Unfortunately, the large Laves phase precipitates could not be completely solu- tionized at 1473 K (1200 °C), although annealing sig- nificantly reduced their volume fraction (compare Figures 5(a) and (b)). The solutionizing anneal also produced a substantial increase in the average grain size from 40 to 250 lm (grain size was measured using the linear line intercept method). As observed for thermo- mechanical treatment Method #1, the residual large Laves phase precipitates also fractured during cold rolling. Upon subsequent annealing, the size of the residual Laves phase precipitates did not change signif- icantly. After the 240 hour anneal, fine-scale particles precipitated out and were evenly distributed in the matrix (Figure 5(f)). These new precipitates presumably nucleated on the dislocations generated during the 90 pct cold rolling. The inset in Figure 5(f) clearly shows precipitates with two different types of brighter contrast, white and light gray, likely due to the presence of two different phase compositions. The light gray phase is likely the Laves phase and the dark gray phase is likely B2 NiAl. These small precipitates were also observed in previous research on AFA alloys.[12,15]Table II shows the average size of the Laves phase precipitates after both thermo-mechanical treatments using the particle size image analysis technique used by Trotter et al.[21] The sizes of the Laves phase precipitates are in the range of 167 to 562 nm, i.e., much smaller than the large Laves phase precipitates in Figures 2 and 3 which are 0.5 to 10 lm. As the annealing time increases from 2.4 to 240 hours, the size of the Laves phase increases from 167 to 417 nm for the samplesTable II.Average Size of Laves Phase Particles Inside of Thermo-mechanical Treated DAFA29Average Size (nm)￼￼Annealing Time (h)2.4 24 240Method #1 166.8 ± 37.1237.2 ± 63.6 417.3 ± 164.9Method #2 174.6 ± 44.9244.3 ± 64.9 562.4 ± 172.7￼￼METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS Atreated by Method #1. The size of the Laves phase in materials treated with Method #2 is slightly larger than those treated by Method #1 for all annealing times. This is due to the extra step of solutionizing in Method #2.Comparing Figures 4 and 5, the BSE images of the samples after the solutionizing anneal show less Laves phase precipitates. This is especially clear in Figure 5(f), where the large Laves phase precipitates are barely observed. Instead, the small precipitates are uniformly distributed in the matrix. The solutionizing anneal used in Method #2 is an effective way to reduce the size and redistribute the Laves phase precipitates, resulting in a finer and denser distribution. Most of the small Laves phase precipitates appeared to be coupled with B2 NiAl precipitates. Figure 6 shows a BSE image of the precipitates. Based on EDS results, the brighter contrast precipitates are either Laves phase or MC carbides and the darker contrast precipitates are B2 NiAl precipitates. The B2 NiAl normally co-precipitates with the Laves phase during the thermo-mechanical treatment process. Such finer and denser distributed Laves phase and B2 NiAl precipitates (size are less than 1 lm) may be effective in further increasing the creep strength.[22]BF TEM images and SAD patterns of DAFA 29 after cold rolling and annealing at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4, 24, or 240 hour (Method #1) are shown in Figure 7. After the 2.4 hours anneal many small grains with an

The SAD pattern shows diffraction rings (Figure 7(d)), a feature characteristic of fine-scale f.c.c. grains having many different orientations. As the annealing time is increased from 2.4 to 240 hours, the grain size increased from ~100 nm to ~1 lm. The diffraction patterns changed accordingly as the number of grains captured within the SAD aperture decreased resulting in a single crystal diffraction pattern from a single grain.In conventional steels, elongated grains and/or aligned second-phase particles parallel to the rolling direction are developed after large strain cold roll- ing.[31,32] For the AFA steels, no elongated grains are observed. Instead, a large number of irregular nanoscale grains are observed in TEM images of the 90 pct cold rolled material after 2.4 hours annealing, indicating that all the grains are fully recrystallized after the 2.4 hours annealing process.METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A
￼Fig. 8—BF TEM images and SAD patterns of DAFA 29 after solutionizing, cold rolling, and annealing at 1073 K (800 °C) for (a, d) 2.4 h, (b, e) 24 h, or (c, f) 240 h (Method #2).BF TEM images and SAD patterns of DAFA29 after a solutionizing anneal at 1473 K (1200 °C), cold rolling, and then annealing at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4, 24, or 240 hours (Method #2) are shown in Figure 8. For the sample annealed for 2.4 hours, many small grains are observed with an average grain size of ~200 nm with the SAD pattern exhibiting diffraction rings (Figure 8(d)). This is similar to 2.4 hour samples after thermo-me- chanical treatment Method #1, where fine grains (~200 nm) are produced by cold rolling and annealing for 2.4 hours. As the annealing time increases from 2.4 to 240 hours, the grain size increases from ~200 nm to ~2 lm.Comparing Figures 7 and 8, the average grain size produced by Method #2 is ~2 times larger than the grain size produced by Method #1, which is due to grain growth during the solutionizing anneal process. This annealing step increases the average grain size of DAFA29 from 40 to 250 lm.After thermo-mechanical treatment, the multiple second-phase precipitates in treated DAFA29 were studied by TEM/EDS/CBED.A BF TEM image and EDS spectrum from a Laves phase precipitate in DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1 annealed for 240 hours are shown in Figure 9. The Laves phase precipitates appear darker than the matrix in the TEM image due to their greater thickness and/or compositional difference (heavy ele- ment Nb), and, hence, greater absorption. The inset in Figure 9(a) shows a CBED pattern from the circled region. The diffraction pattern indicates a hexagonalcrystal structure aligned at [0001]. EDS results from the same region of the Laves phase precipitate, Figure 9(b), indicate that it is enriched in Nb and Fe. The EDS data shows an atomic ratio of Fe to Nb of approximately 2:1, consistent with Fe2Nb precipitates, although the pre- cipitates also contain some other elements.The creep resistance of the alloys strengthened by Fe2Nb Laves phase particles alone was previously found to be relatively low at 1023 K (750 °C) and 100 MPa in air, which was attributed to the relatively coarse size of the Fe2Nb precipitates.[12] Both large size and small size Fe2Nb precipitates can be observed in DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1, as shown in Figure 9. These newly formed small Laves phase pre- cipitates (~1 lm) might be helpful to enhance the creep performance.A BF TEM image and EDS results from a NiAl precipitate in DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treat- ment Method #1 and annealed for 240 hours are shown in Figure 10. The CBED pattern in Figure 10(b) inset corresponds to a B2 structure viewed along the [211] zone axis. EDS analysis results from the circled region of the NiAl precipitate are shown in Figure10(b). Although the precipitates are mostly Ni and Al, they also contain other elements. The NiAl precipitates are observed after both thermo-mechanical treatments. They are not present in the as-received DAFA29. A previous study suggested this B2 phase is likely to increase the creep resistance by affecting dislocation climb in the f.c.c. matrix due to their resistance to dislocation cutting during creep deformation.[15,22]METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A

The EDS data and CBED pattern are from the region circled in the TEM image.The B2 phase precipitates also play an important role for the oxidation resistance of the alloy and work as Al reservoirs, which provide Al to maintain the protective alumina scale on the material’s surface at high temper- ature.[22]A BF TEM image and EDS results from a Ni3Al precipitate on the edge of a thin foil from DAFA29 after thermo-mechanical treatment Method #1 and annealed 240 hours are shown in Figure 11. The Ni3Al precipi- tates are spherical with a diameter less than 100 nm. The inset in Figure 11(a) shows a CBED pattern from the circled region of the Ni3Al precipitate. This corresponds to a pattern from an L12 structure viewed along the [212] zone axis. EDS data acquired from the region circled in the TEM image of this precipitate is shown inFigure 11(b). The atomic ratio of Ni to Al(Ti) is approximately 3:1, with small amounts of other ele- ments present.The average size of the L12 precipitates in this heat- treated alloy is ~84 nm, which is about eight times larger than in the as-received alloy. These L12 precipitates have a similar size to the Ni3Al observed in the AFA alloy after creep tests of 3008 hours at 1023 K (750 °C) and 100 MPa.[20] Besides the spherical L12 precipitates, no other nanoscale particles, such as carbides or borides, are observed after the thermo-mechanical treatments.MC carbide (M: Nb, Ti) precipitates are also observed in DAFA29 both before and after thermo-mechanical treatments.

The inset shows the region from ~38 to ~46 deg expanded.treated DAFA29 sample. The upper inset in Figure 12(b) is an EBSD pattern, indicating that this is the [011] zone axis of a MC precipitate. Both the pattern and EDS results show this is a MC precipitate.Since the lattice parameters of the f.c.c. matrix and L12 precipitates are similar, synchrotron XRD was used to determine their respective lattice parameters in the alloy. Synchrotron XRD results from the DAFA29 samples after a 1473 K (1200 °C) solutionizing anneal for 50 hours, 90 pct cold rolling, and then a 1073 K (800 °C) anneal for 240 hour, are shown in Figure 13. The 240 hour annealed samples were selected for this measurement because the size of precipitates is larger due to particle coarsening, and hence, the XRD signal will be stronger than in the 24 or 2.4 hours annealed samples. In the XRD pattern, the Miller indices of the f.c.c. peaks are labeled in blue, the L12 superlattice peaks are labeled in red, the Laves phase peaks are labeled in black, and B2 peaks are labeled in green.The lattice parameters for each phase were calculated based on the highest angle peaks of each phase. The calculated lattice parameters for the phases in the 240 hour annealed sample were 3.609 A ̊ for the L12 phase, 3.599 A ̊ for the f.c.c. matrix, and 2.892 A ̊ for the NiAl phase. The lattice misfit between the L12 precipitates and the f.c.c. matrix was only 0.28 pct after the 240 hour heat treatment, indicating that very small elastic strain between the precipitates and the f.c.c. matrix is devel- oped.The room temperature tensile test results for DAFA29 after the two different thermo-mechanical treatments are shown in Figure 14. The samples in Figure 14(a) were cold rolled and then annealed at 1073 K (800 °C) for different time. The yield strength and plastic strain to failure of the as-received DAFA29are 560 MPa and 22 pct, respectively. The yield strength increased to 1280 MPa and the plastic strain decreased to 5.1 pct after cold rolling and a 2.4 hour anneal. The yield strength decreased with further annealing; the yield strength of the sample after a 24 hour anneal was 1070 MPa, and was reduced to 800 MPa when the sample was annealed for 240 hours. Surprisingly, the strain to failure for all the cold rolled and annealed samples did not change significantly as the annealing time increased and the yield strength decreased.The samples shown in Figure 14(b) were treated with the additional step of a solutionizing anneal before cold rolling. Again, the yield strength increased to 1150 MPa and the plastic strain decreased to 6.2 pct after this treatment followed by a 2.4 hour anneal. The yield strength decreased to 1020 MPa for an increase in the annealing time to 24 hours, and was further reduced to 750 MPa after an anneal for 240 hours. Again, the strain to failure for the samples treated by this method did not change significantly after cold rolling and different annealing time.The room temperature yield strengths of these treated DAFA29 specimens are four times higher than previous solution heat-treated AFA alloys and two times higher than the aged AFA alloys studied in Reference 22. This difference is mainly due to the nm-scale or lm-scale grains generated after either thermo-mechanical treat- ment. Comparison between Figures 14(a) and (b) reveals that the solutionizing anneal is not effective in enhancing the tensile strength of DAFA29, although it is helpful to reduce the size of Laves phase and produce a finer and denser distribution of the Laves phase precipitates.The tensile test results of the DAFA29 control samples after thermal treatment (Method #1 withoutMETALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A

Simply, the control samples are annealed at 1073 K (800 °C) for different periods without any cold work. The yield strength increased to 747 MPa from 560 MPa and the plastic strain decreased slightly to 20 pct after a 2.4 hour anneal. The yield strength further increased to 890 MPa and the plastic strain decreased to 10 pct after a 24 hour anneal. For a 240 hour annealing time, the yield strength decreased to 760 MPa, while the plastic strain still continued to decrease to 8 pct.For comparison, the tensile test results for DAFA29 control samples after using the thermal treatment (Method #2 without cold work) are shown in Figure 14(d). Basically, the control samples are solutionizing anneal at 1473 K (1200 °C) followed by a anneal at 1073 K (800 °C) for different periods without any cold work. The results show that all the samples after this two-step annealing process are brittle and exhibit no plasticstrain. The yield strength is slightly higher than that of the as-hot-rolled DAFA29 of 560 MPa.In order to better understand the correlation between the grain size and the room-temperature mechanical properties obtained, the Hall–Petch relation for the DAFA29 alloys was determined. The yield strength of the thermo-mechanically treated steel obeys a Hall– Petch relationship between the yield strength r0.2 and the grain size D, i.e.,: ry = r0 + KD 0.5, where r0 = 600 MPa and K = 230 MPa lm 0.5 according to the linear fit to the yield strength vs D 0.5. The value of r0 differs considerably from that obtained in a 63 pct cold-rolled AISI 301 austenitic stainless steel[33] of 252 MPa (the value of K was 270 MPa lm 0.5, similar to this work).The stress r0 can be described, in general, as the sum of several strengthening mechanisms: (1) precipitate strengthening (rppt), (2) strain hardening (rd), and (3)METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A

The estimated rppt is ~289 MPa according to the Eq. [2] and [3] (based on the Orowan looping mechanism) in Reference 341⁄22 where G is the shear modulus, b is the burgers vector, d is the particle diameter, and L is the particle spacing.

The volume fraction of L12 Ni3Al precipitates is 21 pct.[20] Accord- ing to this calculation, the precipitate strengthening rppt contributes almost half of the value of the off-set stress r0. Note the value of rppt is variable and depends on the precipitates size and dislocation-precipitate interaction mechanism.BSE images of the cross-sections of the strained microstructure for DAFA29 after treatment with Method #1, Method #2, Method #1 without cold rolling, and Method #2 without cold rolling are shown in Figures 15(a) through (d), respectively. Figures 15(e) through (h) are the corresponding BSE images of the fracture surface of those four samples. In the sample treated with Method #1 the large Laves phase fractured perpendicular to the applied stress direction (Figure 15(a)). The fracture surface shows small dimples with Lavesand/or B2 phase in the dimple center (Figure 15(e)). Large Laves phase and MC carbide are also observed on fracture surface in this sample. In the sample treated with Method #2 (Figures 15(b) and (f)), the fracture surface shows small dimples similar to Figure 15(e) with size of 1 to 2 lm. In the sample treated with Method #1 without cold rolling (Figures 15(c) and (g)), grain boundary precipitates are generated after annealing for 240 hours. Larger cracks are observed along the grain boundaries. The fracture surface indicates the failures are both on grain boundaries and in the matrix. Both fine grain boundary precipitates and large dimples are observed. For the sample treated with Method #2 without cold rolling (Figures 15(d) and (h)), Laves phase precipitates (exhibiting bright contrast) are pre- sent on the grain boundaries and triple junctions (Figure 15(d)). The fracture surface of the materials after the 240 hour anneal, shown in Figure 15(h), show intergranular fracture. This fracture mode of the mate- rial is different from the others since the grain bound- aries were fully covered by Laves phase and NiAl precipitates. The elongation of this sample is less than 1 pct as shown in Figure 14(d).IV. CONCLUSIONSMicrostructural analysis and mechanical testing of the recently developed AFA stainless steel alloy DAFA29 have been performed in both the as-received condition and after two series of thermo-mechanical treatments. During these treatments, materials were cold rolled to a 90 pct thickness reduction [both with and without a solutionizing anneal at 1473 K (1200 °C)] and then heat treated at 1073 K (800 °C) for 2.4, 24, or 240 hours.It was found that1.

(800 °C) can be used to generate a finer-scale and more uniform distribution of Laves phase precipi- tates.2. The solution anneal produces a large increase in grain size from 40 to 250 lm.3. The alloy contain Fe2Nb Laves phase, MC carbide, Ni3Al(Ti) L12, and B2 NiAl precipitates after either thermo-mechanical treatment.4. Cold rolling produces a high density of dislocations, which act as nucleation sites for Fe2Nb Laves phase, MC carbide, B2 NiAl, and Ni3Al(Ti) precipi- tate formation.5. Nanocrystalline grains are produced after cold roll- ing and short-time anneals, which grow rapidly to lm-scale size on subsequent annealing at 1073 K (800 °C).6. Nanocrystalline steels processed through large strain cold rolling exhibit a dramatic increase in yield strength up to 1280 MPa. The yield strength decreases upon further annealing due to grain growth and pre- cipitate coarsening.7. The yield strength of thermo-mechanically treated AFA steels exhibits a Hall–Petch relationship with a large value for r0 that likely arises from precipi- tate strengthening (rppt).ACKNOWLEDGMENTS2.

The resulting fine-grained TMT materials showed yield stresses more than double the yield stress of the as-received material at room temperature and more than 50% higher at 600 oC, but lower yield stresses (but greater elongations) at 700 oC and above. Strain rate jump tests performed at both 600 oC and 700 oC showed that the TMT materials have greater strain rate sensitivity and lower activation volumes at both temperatures. The strain rate has a power law relationship with the flow stress with a stress exponent of $5. The as-received AFA alloy showed ser- rated stress–strain curves at 600 oC suggesting the occurrence of dynamic strain aging.￼￼￼￼Article history:2223 Received 23 September 2015￼￼￼￼￼3132 Dynamic strain aging 33343536 1. Background 3738 An effective way to enhance the energy conversion efficiency39 and reduce the carbon footprint of fossil fuel power plants is to40 increase their operating temperature and pressure. The operating41 temperature and pressure of current ultra-supercritical (USC)42 power plants are 600 oC/25 MPa which will eventually increase to43 700 oC/35 MPa and then later to 760 oC/35 MPa for the next gen-44 eration of advanced ultra-supercritical (A-USC) power plants [1–45 4]. The materials used for boiler/steam turbine in the A-USC power46 plant must be able to withstand not only this high operating47 temperature, but also excellent oxidation and corrosion resistance,48 49&amp; 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.can provide better oxidation resistance than conventional heat resistant stainless steels in many harsh environments [5,8–12].Recently-developed AFA stainless steels exhibit the promising mechanical properties and oxidation resistance [8–14].

One potential solution is the development of alumina-forming auste-room temperature. The TMTs reduced the grain size significantly to the nanoscale ($100 nm) and increased the room temperature yield strength to above 1000 MPa [15].In this paper, the deformation behavior of this AFA alloy in both the as-received condition and after the TMTs was studied at ele- vated temperatures.

Ingots of the alloys had been hot-rolled at 1100 oC (80%7 thickness reduction with $15–20% thickness reduction per pass)8 and then annealed at 1100 oC for 30 min in Arþ4% H2 gas, fol-9 lowed by air-cooling. The chemical composition of this alloy, as10 analyzed using inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and gas11 combustion techniques at ORNL, is shown in Table 1.12 Two TMTs of the DAFA29 were performed in an attempt to13 produce finer and uniformly distributed precipitates [15]. In the14 first approach (referred to as Method #1), the DAFA29 was cold15 rolled to a 90% reduction in thickness with a $4.5% reduction per16 pass, and then annealed at 800 oC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h. The grain17 sizes of the thermomechanically treated alloys ranged from18 $100 nm to $1 mm depending on different annealing time. In the19 second approach (referred to as Method #2), the alloy was given a20 solutionizing anneal at 1200 oC and then cold rolled to a 90 % re-21 duction in thickness with a $4.5% reduction per pass before an-22 nealing at 800 oC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h. As the annealing time was23 increased from 2.4 to 240h, the grain size increased from24 $200 nm to $2 mm. The as-received DAFA29 has a grain size of25 $ 40 mm with niobium enriched precipitates ( $ 10 mm) randomly26 distributed in the matrix and grain boundaries. After TMT, finer27 and uniformly distributed precipitates ( $ 560 nm) are present.28 Details of the microstructures of these thermo-mechanical treat-29 ments were described in a previous paper [15].3031 2.2. Mechanical testing 3233 Tensile test specimens were milled to dog-bone geometry with34 a gauge length of 10 mm, width of 2.65 mm, thickness of 0.8 mm,35 and polished to a mirror finish using 800 grit silicon carbide pa-36 pers followed by 0.3 μm alumina powder.37 Elevated temperature (600 oC, 700 oC and 800 oC) tensile tests38 were performed with an Instron 5690 tensile testing machine and39 a MTS hydraulic testing machine. A preload force of 50 N was40 applied before the tensile tests. The initial strain rate for all tensile41 tests was 5 10  4 s  1. Elongations were measured directly from42 the gauge of the specimens after the tensile tests. All the tensile43 tests were performed three times for each specimen. The resulting44 test data are shown as true stress–true strain curves.45 Strain rate jump tests were performed on the same tensile test46 machine at 600 oC and 700 oC.

The polished samples were polished with a vib- 75 rometer (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL) for 3 h. The specimens were then 76 examined in an FEI XL-30 field emission gun (FEG) SEM operated 77 at 15 keV, using backscattered electron (BSE) image mode. 78 Thin foils for transmission electron microscope (TEM) ex- 79 amination were produced from 3 mm dia., 200 mm thick discs by 80 twin-jet electropolishing at 9.5 V and $100 mA in a solution of 81 25% nitric acid in methanol at  20 oC using a Struers Tenupol 5. 82 The resulting thin foils were examined using an FEI Tecnai F20 FEG 83 TEM operated at 200 kV and equipped with energy dispersive 84 X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). 85 86 87 3. Results 88 89 3.1. Tensile tests at elevated temperatures 90 91 Tensile tests of TMT Method#1 alloys were performed at 92 700 oC. The stress strain curves of the three TMT alloys are shown 93 in Fig. 1a. All three TMT alloys show lower yield strength but 94 higher elongation compared to the as-received DAFA29, see Ta- 95 ble 2. The tensile behaviors of these TMT alloys at 700 oC are sig- 96 nificantly different from room temperature. They show yield 97 strength above 1000 MPa in room temperature tensile tests [15]. 98 Tensile tests of TMT alloys Method#2 were also carried out at 99 700 oC. The stress strain curves of the three TMT alloys are shown 100 in Fig. 1b. The results are similar to the stress strain curves ob- 101 served for the TMT Method#1 tests. All the TMT alloys show lower 102 yield strength, but higher elongation. The yield strengths (mea- 103 sured as 0.2% proof stress) were in the range of 270–346 MPa, see 104 Table 2. 105 After the tensile tests at 700 oC, all test specimens were char- 106 acterized using the SEM. All the treated samples have different 107 shapes of the necked region because of differences in ductility. 108 TMT (Method#1) alloys after ageing for 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h 109 showed reductions in area of 33%, 64%, and 93%, respectively. The 110 differences in the reduction in area are due to the different grain 111 sizes for these three treated samples [15]. The grain sizes of TMT 112 (Method#1) annealed for 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h samples are 113 $ 100 nm, $ 270 nm, and $ 1 mm, respectively [15]. Thus, the 114 elongation and reduction in area increased with increasing grain 115 size, presumably due to the reduction in yield strength. 116 For TMT alloys treated using Method#2, the reductions in area 117 for the 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h samples were 49%, 67% and 91%, re- 118 spectively. The microstructures of these TMT alloys were shown in 119 our previous work in [15]. The grain size of TMT samples with 120 ageing 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h are $200 nm, $450 nm, and $2 mm, 121 respectively. The 240 h annealed TMT alloy also has the largest 122 area reduction and the highest elongation up to 53% due to the 123 grain growth to larger than 2 mm during 800 oC annealing [15]. 124 Fig. 2 shows fracture surfaces of as-received DAFA29, TMT 2.4 h, 125 24 h and 240 h samples after tensile testing at 700 oC. The fracture 126 surface of as-received DAFA29 shows ductile failure with large 127 ductile dimples and considerable plastic deformation between the 128 dimples. The fracture surfaces of TMT alloys are covered with a 129 thick layer of oxide due to exposure at high temperature during 130 the tensile tests. However, the Laves phase precipitates, which 131 show white contrast, are still visible. There are no dimples evident 132strain rate for all strain rate jump tests was 52.3.

This23 ductility is due to the small grain sizes (ranging from $100 nm to24 1 mm) of these three TMT samples. All three fracture surfaces are25 coved by a layer of oxide formed during tensile test at 700 oC26 As-received and TMT DAFA29 samples were also tested at27 elevated temperatures from 600 oC to 800 oC. The resulting true28 stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 3. At 600 oC (Fig. 3a), the29 stress strain curve of as-received DAFA29 has a yield stress of30 535 MPa, shows considerable work-hardening and an ultimate31 tensile strength of 665 MPa at an elongation of 20%. The TMT al-32 loys showed higher yield strengths of 928 and 886MPa for33 Method#1 and Method#2, respectively. At 800oC, the yield34 strength of as-received DAFA29 decreased to 360 MPa with no35 work-hardening evident. The yield strength of TMT alloys de-36 creased dramatically lower to 150 (Method#1) and 120MPa37 (Method#2) with elongations more than 40%.38 Fig. 4 provides a summary of the yield stress of as-received and39 TMT DAFA29 tested at different temperatures. The behavior of as-40 received DAFA29 is similar to many f.c.c. alloys reported in the41 literature [3,16], i.e.: nickel-base superalloys and nickel iron-base42 superalloy. The yield strength is not greatly affected by the in-43 crease in temperature until it reaches a certain temperature. This44 transition temperature is 600 oC for the as-received DAFA29. The45 flow stress of L12 precipitates increase anomalously with increase46 of temperature. Therefore, the temperature independence of the47 yield strength of AFA alloys until 600 oC is the net effect of strength48 reduction of f.c.c. phase compensated by the increase of strength49 from L12 precipitates [17].50 The TMT AFA alloys show yield stresses significantly larger than51 the as-received DAFA29 at room temperature. This is due to the52 fine grain size present after the TMT process for both TMT meth-53 ods (100–200 nm). Details of the room temperature tensile test54 results were described in previous paper [15]. As the temperature55 increased to 600 oC, the yield stress of the TMT alloys decreased5686 gradually until 600 oC and then decreased dramatically at 700 oC. 87This significant loss of stress in the range of 600–700 oC might be 88 due to increased diffusion rates in TMT alloys leading to fast dis- 89 location climb. The large volume of grain boundaries in TMT alloys 90 lose the function to interrupt of dislocation motion due to the fast 91 dislocation climbing. The grain boundaries work as sites of 92 weakness at above 600 oC. 93At 800 oC, this grain boundary effect is more obvious. The yield 94 strength of TMT alloys is less than half of the yield strength of as- 95 received DAFA29 as shown in Fig. 4. At this temperature, disloca- 96 tions will be able to move around obstacles easily, the grain re- 97 fined TMT alloys become significantly weaker. 9899 3.2. Strain rate jump tests at elevated temperatures 100101 Generally, the flow stress of alloys at elevated temperature is a 102function of the applied strain rate. The magnitude of the effect is 103 expressed by the strain rate sensitivity m. Theoretically, it is pos- 104 sible to carry out a series tensile tests at various temperatures and 105 strain rates. In practice, this is rarely done because of the limita- 106 tions of time and the numbers of specimens required. Instead, 107 strain rate jump tests can be performed using a single specimen. 108 The strain rate is increased to a second level (approximately an 109 order of magnitude) once a steady state flow stress is obtained. 110Strain rate jump experiments were performed on as-received 111 and TMT DAFA29 at 600 oC. The strain rate jump test results are 112 shown in Fig. 5a. The initial strain rate was 5 10 5 s 1 with an 113 order of magnitude increase for each jump. The flow stresses of 114 both TMT alloys increased with the strain rate increases. But, the 115 flow stress of as-received DAFA29 is relatively independent of 116 strain rate at this temperature. It is insensitive to the strain rate 117 change at 600 oC. It is worth noting the serrations that occurred on 118 the as-received DAFA29 during testing at 600 oC. The serrated flow 119 starts when the strain rate jumps from 5 10  5 s  1 to 120 5 10 4 s 1. It is thought to be related to dynamic strain aging in 121￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼57 Table 258 Yield strength, elongation at fracture, and reduction in area at the neck for the as-received and TMT DAFA29 after tensile tested at 700 oC59 60                   122                   123                   124                   125                   126Reduction in area (%) 127 128￼￼￼61 Materials 6263 As-received64 TMT 2.4 h65 TMT 24 hTMT Method#1Yield strength (MPa)523 393 298 225Elongation (%)28 32 38 46Reduction in area (%)30 33 64 93TMT Method#2Yield strength (MPa)523 346 298 270Elongation (%)￼66TMT 240 h2833 49 130 45 67 131 53 9130 129 132￼￼￼￼￼Please cite this article as: B.

Strain rate influence on microstructures 104 105In order to understand the fracture behavior of as-received 106 DAFA29 at different strain rates, tensile tests of as-received 107 DAFA29 alloys were performed at 700 oC for selected strain rates 108 (5 10 6 s 1, 5 10 4 s 1, and 5 10 2 s 1). The resulting true 109 stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 6. The flow stresses are 110 comparable to the results from the strain rate jump test results 111￼35 this material.

Discussion 106 107At 700 oC, the yield strength of as-received DAFA29 is 523MPa 108 and it is slightly lower than its room temperature yield strength 109 560 MPa [15]. It work-hardens significantly with an elongation of 110 20% at room temperature, while it shows low work-hardening rate 111 at 700 oC with an elongation of 28%. 112113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130￼32 in Fig. 7a effectively enhanced the dislocation interactions which33 created additional barriers in the lattice for slip. These barriers￼34 produced the high work hardening rate observed at this strain rate35 (Fig. 6). For the lower strain rates, the dislocation density was also￼￼38 no work hardening and lower dislocation densities. The disloca-39 tions in Fig. 7a are observed to align along one direction. This40 might due to the high strain rate during the tensile test.41 In Fig. 7c, Fe2Nb Laves phase and NiAl precipitates are present.42 These precipitates are located on grain boundaries and they are43 generated during the low strain rate test. Small ( $ 26 nm) sphe-44 rical L12–Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates are also uniformly distributed in45 the f.c.c. matrix. The dislocations show strong interactions with46 these L12 precipitates.

It is evident that the TMTs which result in a fine grain49 size significantly improve the room temperature properties, but50 this grain size strengthening is negligible at 700oC. In room51 temperature, assuming off-set stress s0 is constant for all TMT52 alloys, the estimate grain size strengthening effect is $600 MPa53 according to the △s 1⁄4 KD  1/2 [15,18].54 As the temperature increased to 700 oC, the strengthening ef-55 fect becomes negligible due to the weakness of grain boundaries.56 For the 2.4 h annealed samples, the TMT Method #1 alloy still57 showed higher strength than TMT Method #2 alloy at 700 oC al-58 though it has more grain boundaries (smaller grain size). This is59 mainly because the high temperature strength of TMT alloys has a60 strengthening contribution from the small Laves phase pre-61 cipitates as well as the grain boundaries. The Laves phase pre-62 cipitates in TMT Method #1 alloys are in the range of 167737 nm63 which is slightly smaller than it is in TMT Method #2 alloys64 (175 7 45 nm) [15].65 For all the annealed specimens, the 2.4 h and 24 h annealed66 TMT Method#1 alloys shows higher yield strength compared to111 TMT Method#2 alloys due to a smaller grain size. When the an- 112 nealing time was increased to 240 h, TMT Method#2 alloys have 113 higher strength than TMT Method#2. This might be due to an 114 increase in the volume fraction of the Laves phase during the long 115 time aging process. After 240 h aging, the large Laves phase pre- 116 cipitates in TMT Method#2 alloys are not present. Instead smaller 117 Laves phase are precipitated out with size of $560 nm [15]. In 118 TMT Method#1 alloys, there are still large Laves phase precipitate 119 present in the microstructure. 120 The following section will discuss the strain rate sensitivity of 121 the as-received and TMT DAFA29. The deformation mechanism at 122 elevated temperature will also be discussed based on the flow 123 stress and strain rate for each alloy.

The activation volume for metals is normally expressed in 88 terms of b3, where b is the shortest burgers vector of a perfect 89 dislocation. In f.c.c. iron the Burgers vector is 0.253 nm [24]. The 90 calculated activation volumes for DAFA29 at 700 oC is 1.1 b3, while 91 the values for the TMT alloys are 0.7 b3 (Method#1) and 0.8 b3 92 (Method#2) respectively. The activation volume for the fine 93 grained TMT alloys is smaller than that of the coarse-grained al- 94 loys. Dislocations have a higher activation barrier when the grain 95 size enters the nanometer regime. This is similar to other alloys 96 tested at both room temperature and elevated temperature [24– 97 26]. 9899 4.2.

A stress ex- 110 ponent n in the range of 3–5 is typical for solid solution alloys. 111 Specifically, n is 5 for nickel and nickel–chromium alloys [27–29]. 112 For precipitate-strengthened alloys, the n values obtained are 113 normally larger than the solid solution alloys [30]. The high stress 114 exponent arising from small dispersed precipitates being obstacles 115 to the movement of dislocations [31,32]. 116￼￼￼￼2223 where C is a constant, s is the flow stress, ε̇ is the strain rate, and m24 is the strain rate sensitivity parameter.25 Based on the flow stress results shown in Table 4, the flow26 stress is plotted as a function of strain rate on a log–log scale in27 Fig. 8. The strain rate sensitivity m can be obtained fromof the precipitates. The effective stress is defined as s–st. Thus, Eq. 119120 121 122(5) 123 124 The value of the threshold stress st depends on the dislocation 125precipitate interaction mechanism. The mechanism could be dis- 126 location cutting, Orowan looping, or dislocation climb. This value 127 can be determined using the methodology suggested by Lagne- 128 borg and Bergman [33]. Basically, Eq. (5) can be rewritten: 129ε1/n=A′′(σ−σt) (6) 130 1311/n Thethresholdstressstcanbeobtainedfromaplotofε̇ asa 132(4) can be rewritten as:87￼￼￼￼28 m=log(σ)29 log (ε)̇(2)￼￼3031 The m value can be obtained based on a linear fit as shown in32 Fig. 8. m of as-received DAFA29 is 0.12, while the values for TMT33 DAFA29 is 0.18 (Method#1) and 0.19 (Method#2), i.e. the yield34 stresses of the TMT DAFA29 alloys are more sensitive to strain rate35 compared to the as-received DAFA29 at 700 oC. The slight differ-36 ence in m values for TMT Method#1 and Method#2 is probably37 due to different grain sizes [15]. At 600oC m for as-received38 DAFA29 is 0.02, whereas the m values for the TMT AFA alloys are39 0.08 (Method#1) and 0.09 (Method#2). All the m values obtainedat 600 oC are much smaller than those obtained at 700 oC, in-41 dicating that the strain rate sensitivity is influenced by the tem-42 perature for all tested alloys.43 At both 600 oC and 700 oC, the alloys treated by Method#2 with44 a grain size of $200nm have a slightly higher m than alloys45 treated by Method#1. Alloys treated by Method#1 have a grain46 size of $100nm which is about half size of alloys treated by47 Method#2. It shows an increase in strain rate sensitivity with48 decreasing grain size. This trend has also been observed in other49 nanocrystalline alloys [19,20].50 At the same testing temperature, the strain rate sensitivity is51 larger for the smaller nano-sized grains in the TMT alloys com-52 pared to coarse grains of $ 40 mm for the as-received DAFA29. A53 number of models [19,21,22] indicate a grain size dependence of54 the strain rate sensitivity is related to a decrease in the activation55 volume V.56 The strain rate sensitivity m can also be expressed asdescribed by a power law [7,27]: ⎛ GbD ⎞⎛ σ ⎞n￼￼￼￼￼40ε=̇A⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟ ⎝ kT ⎠⎝G⎠￼￼￼￼In order to reduce the high stress exponent values, a threshold 117stress term st is introduced into Eq.

The particle spacing obtained 94 based on L and the volume fraction is 140 nm [15]. The volume 95 fraction of L12 phase can be calculated based on density and phase 96 fraction from a JMatPro simulation shown in Fig. 11. G is ap- 97 proximately 50GPa for AFA alloys and b is estimate to be 98 0.253 nm. The calculated Orowan shear stress is about 180 MPa for 99 both TMT AFA alloys. The threshold stress values of TMT alloys are 100 about 0.3τo (50 MPa for Method#1) and 0.05τo (9 MPa for Meth- 101 od#2). These values are similar to those obtained from the Arzt– 102 Ashby model for the local climb and general climb mechanisms 103 [35]. For as-received DAFA29, the calculated Orowan shear stress is 104 about 212 MPa with a particle spacing of 120 nm and average 105 particle size of 30 nm. This Orowan stress is consistent with the 106 threshold stresses of as-received DAFA29, which is 217 MPa. 107 At 600 oC, the threshold stress values are much higher than 108 Orowan shear stress for both TMT alloys.

Dynamic strain aging of DAFA2956 At 600 oC, the yield stress of as-received DAFA29 is insensitive7 to the strain rate, as shown in Fig. 5a. The flow stress curve shows8 evidence of negative strain rate sensitivity with significant ser-9 rated flow. This serrated flow starts when the strain rate jumps10 from 5 10  5 to 5 10  4 s  1. This phenomenon is also observed11 for other stainless steels and high temperature superalloys [36–12 40]. The serrated flow is expected to be associated with dynamic13 strain aging (DSA) which occurs at certain combinations of tem-14 perature and strain rate [36,40]. The occurrence of DSA is the re-15 sult of solute diffusion in the metal lattice during plastic de-16 formation at certain temperatures. The accumulation of these so-17 lute elements can impede the movement of dislocations and re-18 sults in serrated flow curves. The solute elements typically re-19 sponsible for this behavior are carbon below 550 oC, and Cr or Mo20 at temperatures above 550 oC [40,41].2122 4.4. DAFA29 is insensitive to strain rate at 600 oC 2324 The yield stress of DAFA29 is not dependent on the strain rate25 at 600 oC. This might be related to the work hardening of DAFA2926 at this temperature. At 700oC or higher, there is little work27 hardening for DAFA29 as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The reduction of28 work hardening in as-received DAFA29 at temperature of 700 oC29 and higher temperature is due to a softening mechanism such as30 dynamic recovery which is expected to become the dominant31 mechanism at elevated temperature [38]. At higher temperatures,32 the work hardening due to the increase in dislocation density with33 increasing strain is counteracted by the formation of subgrains34 with low energy dislocations. Thermally-activated climb of dis-35 locations is the prominent dynamic recovery mechanism for pre-36 cipitate-strengthened alloys. This will overcome the obstacles of37 dislocation motion which is restrained at the lower temperature of38 600 oC. This is also influenced by strain rate during tensile tests39 since the recovery is diffusion controlled process [38].404142 5. Conclusions 4344 In this paper, the recently-developed AFA alloy, DAFA29, was45 treated by two TMT methods. The resulting fine-grained alloys46 were tensile tested at elevated temperature. Their mechanical47 properties were also evaluated by strain rate jump tests at two48 different temperatures. These results were compared to data for49 the as-received AFA alloy. The findings of this research are sum-50 marized as follows:5152 1. 535455 2. 5657585960 3. 616263646566 4.deformation of TMT alloys. When the temperature decrease to 600 oC, the mechanism changes to dislocation shearing as in- dicated by the dramatically increased threshold stress.5. The yield stress of TMT alloys decrease rapidly from 600 oC to 700 oC, which might be because increased diffusion rates in TMT alloys lead to fast dislocation climb at 700 oC. At this tempera- ture, dislocation will be able to move around obstacles easily and the large volume of grain boundaries in TMT alloys work as sites of weakness.6. The flow stress of the as-received AFA alloy is insensitive to strain rate at 600oC due to strong work hardening at this temperature. It also shows significant serrated flow on the stress strain curve, which is associated with dynamic strain aging effect.AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under NETL Award DEFG2612FE0008857.

IntroductionAFAs (alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels) are a new promising class of steels with potential for use in a number of energy-conversion applications [1e9]. For example, there is a cur- rent effort to develop power plant materials with excellent creep strength and corrosion resistance at temperatures &gt;760  C. Increasing the operating temperature improves efficiency with the added benefit of reducing CO2 emissions [10e13]. The relatively low cost of ferritic steels make them desirable candidates, but they have yet to show the creep strength and oxidation resistance needed at high temperatures. Nickel-based superalloys can be used at temperatures in excess of 760  C, but their high cost makes them less desirable for most applications [12,13]. In order for an AFA to be a viable alternative, it must have a strength and creep resistance that are close to or exceed those of Ni-based alloys. AFAs have relied on MC carbides for strength [1,3,4,14], but at temperatures greater than 800  C there is concern that the carbides formed could coarsen and dissolve [4].Further refinement of the Fe2Nb Laves phase particles has po- tential to improve the creep life and high temperature strength of* Corresponding author.

All rights reserved.abstractThe effects of cold work on the microstructural evolution during aging of a solutionized alumina-forming austenitic stainless steel, Fee20Cre30Nie2Nbe5Al (at.%), were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Cold work prior to aging at either 700  C or 800  C facilitated the heterogeneous precipitation of both Laves phase and B2-type NiAl precipitates. While often co-located after cold work, these particles were distinct. g0-Ni3Al precipitates were also observed in samples aged at 700  C with 90% prior cold work. Compared to material that had not been strained, defects introduced by 50 and 90% cold work at 700  C and 90% cold work at 800  C not only caused a more rapid precipitation in the matrix but also an increase in the total volume fraction of precipitates as compared to material that had been simply aged.￼￼￼! 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, previous studies that looked to Laves phase particles for strength have only seen low or mod- erate creep resistance [14,17]. Decreasing the precipitate size and increasing the volume fraction would enable the precipitates to effectively pin dislocations and extend creep life. A Laves phase dispersion with particles less than 100 nm in diameter is recom- mended to obtain creep-levels on-par with MC carbide strength- ened austenitic stainless steels [17].One pathway to reducing the size and increasing the volume fraction of Laves phase precipitates in the matrix is to nucleate precipitates on dislocations. Nucleation on dislocations is an effect first modeled by Cahn [18] in 1957 and occurs because it lowers the total strain energy of an embryo. In order to effectively reduce the interfacial energy, precipitates that nucleate on dislocations should be well-matched on at least one matrix plane so they are able to form low-energy coherent or semi-coherent interfaces [19]. Images of Fe2Nb that has precipitated in austenite alloys that have the base components of AFAs (Fee20Cre35Nie2Nb and Fee20Cre25Nie 2Nb) [15] show strain contrast in TEM images that is indicative of a semi-coherent precipitate-matrix interface, making Fe2Nb a promising candidate for precipitation on dislocations in AFA-type alloys.Prestraining via cold work introduces dislocations that could dramatically affect the precipitation of the Laves phase, similar to￼￼￼
what has been observed in previous studies of other precipitate systems [20e23]. The effectiveness of prestraining before aging in changing microstructure and improving material properties de- pends on characteristics of the particular alloy system analyzed and the synergy of a number of different variables including, but not limited to: aging temperature, the amount of prestrain, and competing precipitation phenomena. For example, the improved hardness observed in a copper-bearing steel that had been pre- strained prior to aging at 300  C was attributed to additional par- ticle nucleation on dislocations or excess vacancies arising from prestraining, however at an aging temperature of 500  C the pre- strain had little effect on hardness or particle nucleation [21]. In aluminum alloys cold work has been shown to have different ef- fects depending on the alloy system, with dislocations enhancing hardening by providing nucleation sites for precipitates in the Ale Cu, AleCueMg, and AleCueLi systems, while not proving effective for hardening in other aluminum systems [24]. Severe plastic deformation by cold rolling at room temperature followed by subsequent aging has been shown to improve both strength and ductility in a high strength AleMgeSi alloy [23] as well as a CueAg alloy [22]. An increase in precipitation after cold work has been observed with other precipitates in alloys more closely related to AFAs. HTUPS (high-temperature ultrafine-precipitation- strengthened steel) alloys, modified for Al2O3 formation, are cold worked to enhance the precipitation of nanoscale MC carbide precipitates during creep [1,14,25]. While aging studies on AFA- type alloys have been done in the past [16], Laves phase pre- cipitates have yet to be targeted via a combined aging and cold working approach.In this study, the effect of cold work on a solution-annealed AFA- type alloy, Fee20Cre30Nie2Nbe5Al (at.%) was investigated by comparing samples that had received cold work prior to aging to those that were simply aged. Microstructural analysis was per- formed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). In addition, the effect of cold work and aging on the hardness of the material was examined.2. ExperimentalFee20Cre30Nie2Nbe5Al (at.%) ingots were arc melted and drop cast into a copper mold 15.2 cm long 2.5 cm in diameter under argon. Common cast features [26] were observed: there was some segregation and a central pore was created during the so- lidification process. The as-cast material was homogenized in vac- uum for 24 h at 1250  C, then water-quenched. This solutionizingtreatment was used since SEM investigations confirmed that it enabled the formation of a solutionized single phase matrix.Specimens were milled to 4 mm 4 mm w13 mm, and some were cold-rolled with approximately a 0.3 mm reduction per pass until the desired thickness reduction (50 or 90% ` 1%) was ach- ieved. Unrolled, 50% rolled, and 90% rolled samples were aged in air for24hand240hat700 C,andfor2.4,24,and240hat800 C.The resulting microstructures were examined using a FEI XL30 field emission gun (FEG) SEM operated at 15 kV and a FEI Tecnai F20ST FEG TEM operated at 200 kV, both equipped with EDS. For SEM examination samples were mechanically polished to a mirror finish using 0.05 mm alumina powder in a water suspension. TEM samples 3 mm in diameter and w100 mm thick were electrolytically thinned using a twin-jet electropolisher at about  20  C and 11V in a so- lution of 25% nitric acid in methanol. TEM specimens were exam- ined using a Phillips CM200 FEG STEM operated at 200 kV that allowed for elemental mapping via EDS. Vickers hardness testing was conducted using a Leitz MINIload tester under a load of 1.96 N (200 g) with a 15 s dwell time at room temperature. No less than 10 indents were made for each condition.SEM images taken at 8000 were processed and analyzed using ImageJ [27]. BSE images were used for particle analysis since BSE atomic number contrast allowed for optimal differentiation and detection of the matrix, Laves phase, and NiAl precipitates. The image processing routine included contrast enhancement followed by thresholding to include bright or dark contrasted regions to delineate Laves or NiAl particles, respectively. Images were then despeckled and outlier filters were run and small artifacts removed in the final binarized image. The particle parameters calculated include area fraction and equivalent circle diameter given as 2(A/ p)1/2, of a circle with equivalent area A. SEM resolution limits and image quality was taken into account in order to minimize error. Segmented areas that had low pixel counts that corresponded to particles with a diameter smaller than 20e60 nm were excluded from the results.3. ResultsFig. 1 shows bright-field TEM images with accompanying selected area diffraction (SAD) patterns of precipitates observed in Fee20Cre30Nie2Nbe5Al (at.%). After the solution treatment the average grain size was 865 mm.

later) are C14-type Fe2Nb phase (Fig. 1(b)) and that the darker precipitates are B2-ordered NiAl (Fig. 1(c)). The presence of both Laves phase and NiAl precipitates is in agreement with previous TEM analysis on precipitates in this alloy [17] and is typical of AFA- type alloys [1e9].After sufficient aging and/or prior cold work Laves phase and B2eNiAl precipitates often appear interconnected. For example, Fig. 2 shows a dark field STEM image and EDS elemental maps of a specimen reduced by 50% and then aged for 240 h at 800  C. The EDS maps and spectral data of Laves and B2-precipitates reveal that while the nickel makes up a large component of the matrix, it couples with the aluminum and is concentrated in the NiAl parti- cles. Compared to the Al-rich B2 precipitate, the Nb-rich Laves phase precipitate has a lower aluminum (1.5 at.% vs. 20.7 at.%) and nickel (18 at.% vs. 43.6 at.%) content, and a higher iron (40 at.% vs. 25.1 at.%), chromium (15.0 at.% vs. 10.2 at.%) and aluminum (25.5 at.% vs. 0.4 at.%) content. The EDS maps also reveal that while often co-located after cold work, the NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitatesare distinct. TEM investigation of specimens after 90% cold work followed by aging at 700  C show the presence of fine g0-Ni3Al (L12) precipitates (Fig. 3). These precipitates have been observed in creep rupture samples of this alloy at 750  C 100 MPa and were noted to improve creep resistance [17].Microstructural changes are shown as a function of rolling reduction and annealing time after aging at 700  C in Fig. 4. When the Fee20Cre30Nie2Nbe5Al (at.%) alloy is as-aged at 700  C without prior cold work, no Laves phase precipitates were visible in the BSE images of the matrix up to 240 h (Fig. 4(a) and (d)). With cold work prior to aging at 700  C both the B2 and Laves phase particles are globular in shape and are almost always coupled together in the matrix (Fig. 4(b), (c), (e) and (f)). Specimens with 50% (Fig. 4(b)) and 90% (Fig. 4(c)) cold work prior to aging for 24 h at 700  C had a non-uniform, but fine distribution of Laves phase particles with slightly larger B2 particles in the matrix. A similar pattern of increased precipitation after cold work was observed after a 240 h anneal at 700  C (Fig. 4(d)e(f)).Author's personal copy122 G.

Fig. 5 shows the microstructural evolution of the alloy at 800  C as a function of rolling reduction and annealing time. At 800  C the microstructural response to aging and cold work was markedly different to that at 700  C. NiAl and Laves phases precipitated at 800  C, but Ni3Al particles were not stable at this temperature. Unlike at 700  C, at 800  C with no cold work, precipitates are visible both in the matrix and on the grain boundaries after 2.4 h (Fig. 5(a)). The Laves phase precipitates are elongated. Precipitateson the grain boundary are larger than those in the matrix and there are no NiAl precipitates visible in the matrix, but they are present on the grain boundary. After 24 h there is a significant increase in the size of the Laves phase precipitates in the matrix and some are coupled with the B2-ordered NiAl precipitates (Fig. 5(d)). The Laves phase precipitates are needle-like and have several preferred ori- entations in the matrix. After 240 h more NiAl particles are present. From Fig. 5(g) they do not appear to be homogeneously distributedAuthor's personal copyG. Trotter et al. / Intermetallics 53 (2014) 120e128 123Fig. 4.

in the matrix, but are co-located with Laves phase precipitates similar to the observations at 700  C.Faster precipitation kinetics after cold work were also observed at 800  C as compared to 700  C when holding the aging time constant at 2.4 h (Fig. 5(a)e(c))), 24 h (Fig. 5(d)e(f)), and 240 h (Fig. 5(f)e(i)). After 50% cold work Laves phase precipitates are present in the matrix and on the grain boundary (Fig. 5(b), (e) and (h)), displaying a preferred orientation relationship with the matrix as observed in the as-aged case. With 90% cold work (Fig. 5(f) and (i)) the microstructure more closely resembles that of the alloy with cold work at 700  C. The Laves phase no longer appears elongated, but is granular in shape without any obvious preferred growth direction. Also, in the samples aged at 800  C after 90% cold work on increasing the annealing time from 24 h to 240 h (Fig. 5(f) and (i)) it appears there is growth of both the Laves phase and B2 decorated subgrain boundaries. While Laves phase precipitation was the main target of this study, samples with 90% cold work highlight once again how cold work influenced the precipitation process so that Laves was concurrent with NiAl precipitation. For example, whereas it was noted that an aging treatment of 2.4 h at 800  C (Fig. 5(a)) did not show significant NiAl precipitation, the same heat treatment after a 90% rolling reduction showed the matrix inun- dated with both NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitates (Fig. 5(c)). Without cold work, the B2 NiAl precipitates were rarely observed in the matrix except for after long aging times (Fig. 5(g)).In Fig. 6(a) the Vickers hardness of the solutionized alloy at 700  C (w160 HV) increased with subsequent aging for 24 h and 240 h (w300 and w367 HV respectively). 50 and 90% reductions prior to aging improved the hardness at each aging time by at least 90 HV compared to the as-aged state. Within the 240 h aging period, the alloy only shows a hardness peak ( w495 HV) after a 90% rolling reduction prior to aging for 24 h. Subsequent aging to 240 h saw a slight decrease to w471 HV. In a similar manner to the 700  C aged samples, aging at 800  C led to increased hardness after 50% and 90% rolling reductions prior to aging compared to the as- aged material at each time interval (Fig. 6(b)). However, for each reduction condition, there was an initial increase in hardness after 2.4 h and a subsequent decrease in hardness with further aging at 800  C. For example, samples without cold work and those with reductions of 0%, 50%, and 90% saw hardness drop between aging at 2.4hand24h.4. DiscussionThe above results show that cold rolling after solutionizing, but prior to aging, produces both more rapid precipitation of the Laves phase in the matrix and causes matrix precipitation of NiAl at 700  C and 800  C and of Ni3Al at 700  C. With aging, the Laves precipitates show a trend of initially fast growth followed by sub- sequent slower coarsening as observed in a 9CrW steel [28]. AsAuthor's personal copy124 G.

Samples that were simply aged without prior cold work show precipitation trends similar to those observed by Takeyama [15] of the precipitation of Laves phase on the grain boundary and within the grain for the alloy Fee20Cre 30Nie2Nb after aging. The generated TimeeTemperature-Precipi- tation (TTP) diagram showed that after aging for 1200 h at 800  C Laves phase particles also precipitated homogeneously in the ma- trix with grain boundary precipitates being larger than those in the matrix. After 24 h at 800  C the coarsening of the C14-type phase was mostly complete, except for where the C-14-type phase wascoupled with the NiAl-type B2 phase. The Fe2Nb and the NiAl phase has also shown thermal stability after 2160 h at 800  C in an Fee 20Cre15Nie5Al-base alloy [14] and at 2012 h in other AFA alloys [16]. The Laves phase precipitates consistently grew along only a few directions within a given grain.Image analysis of particle size at 700  C (Figs. 7 and 8) and 800  C (Figs. 9 and 10) provides insight into how aging and cold work impacted NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitate growth. A lognormal distribution shows the best fit for most of the sample data. At 700  C cold work induced precipitate formation of the Laves (Fig. 7) and B2eNiAl (Fig. 8). These precipitates saw modest in- creases in size when aging from 24 to 240 h. This early precipitate￼Fig. 9.

This is an effect that has been seen in alpha- iron, where cold work samples caused precipitation to occur at a much lower temperature (250  C) than in samples that had simply been aged (525  C) and was also attributed to lattice defects increasing the diffusion of the precipitate-forming element [29]. At 800  C with 0, 50% and 90% cold work both Laves and B2e NiAl precipitate sizes more than doubled when aging from 2.4 to 240 h (Figs. 9 and 10). The same was true for the NiAl except for the case of 90% cold work where the average particle size was relatively stable in going from 24 to 240 h. 50% cold work did not increase the volume fraction of precipitates compared to the as- annealed state, while 90% cold work led to a larger volume frac- tion of precipitates. In all cases, the standard deviation of the particle sizes increased with aging. TEM images of samples aged at the shorter 2.4 h interval showed very few particles existed below the data collection range used in the SEM so volume fraction re- sults are expected not to be significantly impacted by SEM reso- lution limits.A refined matrix that had reduced precipitate size and increased volume fraction was the desired microstructure for improved creep strength. In all cases up to 240 h at 700  C Laves and NiAl particles did not show large increases in size and were w30e70 nm above the upper 100 nm size limit (Figs. 7 and 8). At 800  C while Lavesparticles initially started out in the 100 nm range, they grew to over 250 nm after aging at 240 h (Fig. 9). NiAl particle size increased to over 300 nm with just aging and with 50% cold work. Particle size did not increase as rapidly in going from 24 h (181 nm) to 240 h (188 nm) after 90% cold work (Fig. 10). Even though particles over 100 nm were observed after 240 h, cold working the material did lead to a higher volume fraction of precipitates. Despite particle growth at 700  C and 800  C, for each aging condition samples with 90% cold work had the highest total volume fraction of Laves and NiAl precipitates (Table 1).The faster precipitation kinetics observed in the austenitic alloy Fee20Cre30Nie2Nbe5Al after cold work is not unusual. For example, in as-cast FeNiMnAl alloys, b-Mn-structured particles only precipitate out after long anneals, but the high dislocation densities and large concentrations of vacancies in samples that have been mechanically milled accelerates their nucleation significantly [30]. Similarly, in 316 austenitic stainless steels, it was speculated that an acceleration of intermetallic precipitation could occur due to the speeding up of substitutional diffusion via an increased defect concentration. Laves-phase precipitation was accelerated after cold work and it was hypothesized that it was the result of increased diffusivity of elements that made up the Laves phase [20]. Takeyama’s analysis indicated that in Fee20Cre30Nie 2Nb the formation of the Laves phase was controlled by Nb

In general, the distribution of the particles after cold work was non- uniform. At both 700 and 800  C the alloy microstructure after cold work is not as homogeneous as for alloys that had simply been aged due to the presence of features such as deformation bands, cellular networks etc. The precipitation structure would most likely have been more uniform after deformation had par- ticles been present during the rolling reduction, but since the starting point was a fully-solutionized matrix, their distribution was affected by the dislocation structures that were introduced by cold work [31].Both the Laves and NiAl phases are no longer elongated and are instead globular after 90% cold work followed by aging at 800  C. The globular precipitates observed after 50% cold work at 700  C and 90% cold work at 800  C appeared to have no preferred crys- tallographic orientation. A number of factors could have influenced this change in morphology. Their shape may have been influenced by their general appearance on grain boundaries and densely packed dislocations. Their concurrent precipitation also may have affected growth. When Takeyama compared Fee20Cre35Nie2Nb to Fee20Cre25Nie2Nb the Laves phase morphology was shown to change with the c/a ratio. It was also demonstrated that the alloy with decreased nickel content contained a Laves phase that was smaller and less elongated [15].The hardness for the alloy aged at 700  C is reflective of changes brought about by aging and cold work (Fig. 6(a)). As Laves and NiAl particles form their constituent atoms contribute less to solution strengthening and more to precipitate strengthening. At 700  C after 50% cold work, hardness increases in conjunction with an increase in the volume fraction of both NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitates. With 90% cold work there is increased hardness as compared to 50% cold worked samples with a peak in hardness at 24 h, the decrease at 240 h is most likely influenced by particle growth. The presence of the Ni3Al particles most likely contributes to the higher hardness values seen at 700  C compared with those seen at 800  C. At 800  C a hardness peak is not only observed after a 90% reduction, but also with a 50% reduction and by simply aging. The higher temperature is most likely the reason behind the increased aging rate due to the aforementioned enhanced diffu- sion through the matrix. At 800  C with no cold work the single hardness peak is consistent with simple nucleation and precipitate growth. With the rise in the volume fraction of NiAl (0.3%e2.6%) the NiAl precipitates increase by nearly a third in size (194 vs. 322 nm), which may be the cause of the decrease in hardness (Fig. 6(b)). With 90% cold work, after aging at 800  C for 24 h a large hardness decrease is congruent with the growth of recrys- tallized grains (Fig. 5(c)). After 240 h (244 Hv), the recrystallization that has occurred at 800  C results in a hardness similar to the 240 h as-aged condition (242 HV).5. ConclusionsCold work resulted in the creation of a defect structure that facilitated the heterogeneous precipitation of both C14-type Fe2Nb- type and B2-type NiAl precipitates. Increasing the amount of cold work caused the B2 phase to precipitate out after shorter anneals and at a lower temperature. Both B2 and Laves phases experienced more rapid precipitation in the matrix compared to material that had not been strained prior to aging at 700  C and 800  C. g0-Ni3Al precipitates were also noted after a 90% rolling reduction prior to aging at 700  C. Rolling reductions of 50 and 90% followed by aging at 700  C and a 90% rolling reduction followed by aging at 800  C was shown to be effective in accelerating precipitation and refining the precipitates in Fee20Cre30Nie2Nbe5Al. At 700  C, cold work was effective in increasing precipitate volume fraction at each aging condition when compared to samples that were simply aged. The change in the kinetics occurring at the higher temperature of 800  C influenced the effects of aging and cold work. For example, hardness peaks were observed with and without cold work. Pre- cipitate size also generally increased. In the case of 90% cold work, the number density of precipitates only decreases with time even though the combined precipitate number density peaked and more than tripled within a short time period as compared to simply aged samples. Even when taking coarsening into consideration, with 90% cold work, the combined NiAl and Laves phase volume fraction increased. The increased precipitation caused by sufficient levels of cold work resulted in increased hardness when compared to ma- terial that had been simply aged.AcknowledgmentsAcknowledgment is made to the donors of the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund #49157-ND10 and the National Science Foundation Grant DMR 1206240 for support of this research.

            <Text>OVERVIEW
Even with the increasing use of renewable energy, the primary energy sources for the foreseeable future for power generation are likely to be fossil fuels. Thus, it is critical to use these resources as efficiently as possible for both economic reasons and to minimize carbon dioxide emissions. Increasing a power plant’s operating temperature from 873 K to 1073 K increases efficiency from &lt;40% to &gt;50%, which requires materials that are creep-resistant, can withstand oxidative and corrosive environments, and are economically viable. Affordable materials that can satisfy these requirements may also find application in supercritical CO2 cycles and as tubing for molten salts for concentrated thermal solar power systems. Unfortunately, current martensitic/ferritic alloys are limited to operating temperatures of ≤873 K. A number of recent efforts have focused on devising new austenitic steels strengthened with Laves phases whose purpose is to provide a “grain boundary (GB) precipitation strengthening mechanism”. The best recently-developed alloy (at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory) is an alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steel that contains L12, B2 and C14 Laves phase precipitates, which has a creep-rupture life at 1023 K and 100 MPa that is an order of magnitude longer than that of the iron-based superalloy A286. While great progress has been made in the development of AFA stainless steels, how the multiple precipitates present contribute to the high temperature creep strength and affect the ductility is poorly understood. 

Intellectual merit of the proposed activity
The aim and intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to ascertain the deformation mechanisms associated with GB precipitation strengthening, and to understand the fundamental deformation behavior in alloys containing both a precipitate free zone (PFZ) and multiple types of precipites in both the GBs and the matrix each of which can contribute differently to the deformation behavior. The work will be performed on the model AFA stainless steel Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al, which was chosen because it has good mechanical properties, it can be fully solutionized at 1523 K and because of our experience with it. The work will examine the effects of different amounts of lattice precipitation and GB coverage by precipitates on creep behavior. We will also determine why the material can exhibit extensive room temperature elongation when the GBs are almost completely covered in brittle phases. Detailed microstructural and defect characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) wlll be performed before and after mechanical testing. TEM in-situ straining and SEM in-situ straining studies performed at 293 K and 1033 K will examine both dislocation/precipitate and dislocation/GB interactions, including understanding the role of the PFZ along the GBs.  

Broader Implications of the Proposed Activity
The broader implications of the proposed activity include the training of both a Ph.D. student and several undergraduates. All Ph.D. students are required to take Ethics training. The student will attend professional development seminar series such as the Learning Community for Future Faculty offered by Dartmouth's Center for the Advancement of Learning (DCAL), which covers principles of learning, lesson design, collaborative learning, inclusiveness/diversity, and practice teaching. Dartmouth is one of the first institutions to become an Affiliate of the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science through which we have a ten-week cross-disciplinary course for graduate students in science communication. Dartmouth’s Outreach Office works with DCAL to integrate these trainings with opportunities for hands-on application through science outreach in local schools, such as lunch-time Science Cafes where graduate students have informal conversations with middle school youngsters about their fields, and Science Pubs, in which community members and researchers have lively conversations about science topics. Both the Outreach Office and DCAL undertake assessments of graduate student professional development programs for continuous quality improvement. Outcomes of the Engineering Ph.D. program are assessed through both a Thayer School survey and an on-line survey. The work will also be performed by a number of undergraduates, typically two per year, who will work closely with the P.I. and the Ph.D. student. The P.I. has a strong record of mentoring undergraduates, particularly women in his research. The work will also involve collaboration with Dr. Eric Stach of the Brookhaven National Laboratory.
Elucidating the interactions between dislocations and the multiple precipitates in AFA steels, will help not only in their future design, but will also aid in the design of other advanced alloys that contain multiple types of brittle intermetallics. It will illuminate whether brittle GB precipitates or the inclusion of precipitates that are softer than the matrix are useful for creep strengthening. Finally, it will attempt to understand why substantial tensile ductility is possible even when the GBs are covered with brittle phases, which will aid in their incorporation, rather than avoidance – as is current practice, in other alloys systems. The deliberate incorporation of brittle intermetallic compounds represents a paradigm shift in alloy design.
The results will be published in refereed journals and presented at conferences.

	2.1	Introduction	
	This chapter details materials preparation and processing methods, the design and testing of a constant-stress creep apparatus, and materials characterization techniques involved in this work.
2.2	Materials Preparation
2.2.1	Materials Used  
		The alloy Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at.%) was used for both the creep and strain-rate jump tests throughout this study. The alloy was provided by Carpenter Technology Corporation (Wyomissing, PA). A split-cast vacuum induction melting heat was used to cast the alloy into tapered ingots. The ingots were then press forged into rectangular bars with the following dimensions: 0.625” x 0.75’’ x 24’’. The chemical composition of the alloy was analyzed by LECO combustion analysis and X-ray Fluorescence. Table 2.1 compares the analyzed element compositions with the theoretically calculated weight percent ratios, demonstrating agreement between the predicted and actual chemical composition of the cast alloy.

2.2.2	Sample Machining 
		In preparation for both creep testing and strain-rate jump tests, the alloyed material was machine milled and then sectioned with a saw. The TRAK DPM SX3P bed mill with a 40 taper spindle and ProtoTRAK SMX control was used with zinc-coated carbide end mills to mill the specimens into the T-bone shapes necessary to insert into the specimen grips of the creep testing and strain-rate jump testing machines as shown in Figure 2.1. To ensure the accurate geometry of each T-bone, the specimen was sectioned using coolant with a Model 650 Low Speed Diamond Wheel Saw from South Bay Technology, Inc.

2.2.3	Material Homogenization and Heat Treatments 
		Solutionizing anneals were necessary to homogenize the material for a uniform microstructure. For all tests in this study, the as-cast model alloy was homogenized for 24 h at 1250ºC in a vacuum and then water-quenched. This temperature and time was chosen with consideration to prior work with Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al, where it was determined that a solutionized single phase γ-matrix could be consistently formed. This was confirmed with SEM images of the as-cast raw material and compared with the material after a heat treatment homogenization conducted at 1250ºC for 24 h.  
		All solutionizing heat treatments were conducted using a Thermo Scientific Type 54233 Lindberg Closed-Shell tube furnace. Specimens were placed on top of a piece of alumina and maneuvered to the center of the furnace tube with a rod. The furnace tube was then purged with argon and placed under a pressure of 0.01 MPa to maintain an oxygen-free environment and to prevent oxidation of the sample inside the furnace until the heat treatment was complete. Once the sample was sealed inside the furnace, the furnace was turned on and the temperature set to 1250ºC. When the solutionizing anneal was complete, the pressure seal was broken and the sample rapidly quenched in water with a substantially greater mass compared to the sample. 
		All heat treatments of the samples after they were homogenized were conducted at 800ºC for a variety of time intervals of 0, 2.4, 24 or 240 h. Heat treatments were conducted in a Barnstead Thermolyne Type 47900 Furnace. Samples were placed inside an alumina crucible and then positioned at the center of the furnace for the duration of the heat treatment. At the completion of the heat treatment, the samples were quenched with water. 
2.3	Constant-Stress Creep Apparatus Design and Testing
2.3.1	Overview of constant-stress creep testing
		Creep testing machines take several forms depending on what is the primary target of investigation, which includes constant load, variable stress and constant-stress rigs. A small change in the level of stress can have a large effect on strain rate affecting both the overall creep rate and microstructure of the sample. With increasing strain, the cross-sectional area A of a test specimen decreases, which if tested in a constant-load creep rig, results in an increase in the instantaneous stress. With a load P, cross-sectional area A, the stress on the specimen will be σ = P/A. A constant-stress machine would allow the stress variable to be controlled by compensating for the decrease in the specimen’s cross-sectional area by decreasing the effective load applied on the specimen. This allows the basic creep mechanisms acting on the specimens tested to be isolated and analyzed.
		The curve of the constant-stress cam is key to constructing a precise, operational constant-stress creep apparatus. In Figure 2.2, a schematic layout of the weight-transferring system is shown for a constant-stress creep test applications. For constant-load creep tests, the curved cam would be circular.
￼
Figure 2.2: A schematic diagram detailing a weight-transferring system used for constant-stress creep tests. { | Garofalo, et al., 1962 | | |zu:2902168:5TKQ6V7D}    
		 The curved profile of the constant-stress cam is analytically calculated using a system of parametric equations following the outline of an Andrade-Chalmers beam { | da C. Andrade, &amp; Chalmers, 1932 | | |zu:2902168:SKTT22IB}.  It is shown that the fixed Cartesian coordinates x and y of a constant-stress cam can be written in terms of constants and the angle θ (see Appendix I for derivation of equations (1) and (2)), where θ is the angle the cam makes with the horizontal as seen in Figure 2.3 from the paper by Garofalo et al (1962). In equations (1) and (2) L0 is the initial specimen gauge length prior to creep, r0 is the initial moment arm, R is the radius of the smaller load-transferring wheel. The Cartesian coordinates from which the profile of the cam can be traced for machining are determined by the values of constants a and b:

		For the purposes of this investigation, a constant-stress creep test rig was custom-designed, built and its operation validated based on the methods developed by Garofalo, Richmond and Domis (1962). The following section discusses the system’s dimensions, assembly, cam parameters, calibration and testing procedure. 
2.3.2	Design of Creep Test rig  
		As discussed in the previous section, the cam profile is dictated by the constants a and b. For a small load-transferring wheel with a radius of 0.75 inches, an initial specimen gauge length of 0.787 inches and a desired mechanical advantage of 8:1, the values of a = 6.00 in and b = 0.95 in.	Using the derived equations (1) and (2) and the calculated values of a and b, the Cartesian coordinates of the cam’s profile in x and y can be calculated for a given angle θ as shown in Table 2.2.

		The metal frame (L) of the rig is made of 1.5-in galvanized steel perforated tubing for heavy duty telescoping framing and is bolted onto four base mounts to account for uneven floor surfaces. The metal frame additionally supports the Mellen Inc. SCR Split Series 120 V 1200 W Furnace (H) mounted vertically. The furnace utilizes clamshell-heating elements capable of 1250ºC in air. The temperature is measured with a centrally located K-type thermocouple and controlled by a Mellen Inc. PS105 programmable power control cabinet. Two heavy-duty ball bearing pillow blocks (B) are rigidly attached to the steel frame and support a 0.75-in diameter steel rod that acts as the cam and load-transferring wheel support shaft. 
		The constant-stress cam (A) and the load-transferring wheel (M) are mounted on the steel rod with a diametrical interference fit of 0.003-in, which facilitates free circular movement around the rod. The cam profile shown in Figure 2.2 is duplicated, inverted and attached to the original cam profile to balance the cam assembly when it’s threaded onto the support rod. The small radius load-transferring wheel is designed for an 8:1 mechanical advantage. Both the cam and the wheel are attached to the center support shaft with a collet and two set screws placed on opposing sides and screwed in to firmly secure the components and eliminate movement when the system is under load. The cam and the load-transferring wheel are fabricated from 1018 steel. Appendix II contains CAD drawings with specifications of the cam and load-transferring wheel. 
		The TransTek Inc. Series 600 Model 0603-0000 Angular Displacement Transducer (ADT) with 100 mV/° output and maximum usable range of ±40° is attached (E) with a set screw to the end of the support shaft extending 1 inch past the pillow block and steel frame tubing. The ADT allows for measuring specimen elongation by tracking the angular displacement of the cam shaft as the sample lengthens throughout the duration of a creep test. More specifically, as the specimen creeps, the relative displacement of the two specimen grips is detected by the ADT. This angular displacement is translated into an electrical signal, which is then amplified
by the TransTek Inc. Series D100 Dual DC 12VDC Power Supply and sent by the readout wire to the Grant Instruments Ltd. SQ2010 Portable Universal Input Squirrel Data Logger (N) to monitor, measure and record the elongation of the specimen. The high accuracy ADT is capable of measuring an angular displacement of ±0.10 %, which translates to measuring a linear displacement of &lt;0.001 in. The ADT is supported with an aluminum bolted frame (F) to eliminate any torque placed on the high-precision measurement equipment. 
		Both the constant-stress cam and the load-transferring wheel have a 0.047-in radius milled groove on their outlines to create a track that allows for a 3/32-in wire cable to fit and wrap around with a snug fit. A wire 3/32-in cable (C) is attached to the constant-stress cam through a pinhole, shown in Figure 2.5, and swaged together with wire rope sleeves. The other end of the cable is swaged in the form of a loop and permits the attachment of a dead-weight load. The load is attached through the use of an 8-inch long metal hook threaded through the center of an aluminum 6x6-in square platform (D). The load is stacked on the platform. The material used for the applied load consists of steel 1/4-in diameter balls to aid in applying a variety of loads with precision.

￼
Figure 2.5: Design drawing of constant-stress cam 
		One end of a wire 3/32-in cable (I) is attached and swaged through a pinhole to the load-transferring wheel (M) on the opposite side that the cable is attached to the constant-stress cam. The other end of the cable drops vertically down to connect through two attachment openings in the vertically aligned Omega Engineering Inc. LC101-500: 500 lb S-beam load cell (K), which acts as the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The LVDT output wires are connected to the data logger (N) and Omega Engineering Inc. DP25B-S-A series Digital Panel Meter with a 4-digit LED display that aids in adjusting the cam placement when a load is applied by displaying the output in lbf units. A wire cable is attached through the bottom of the LVDT to a swageless thread terminal (J). 
		The thread terminal is screwed into the machined upper extension connecting rod (G). The extension rod is screwed into the upper male end of the machined specimen grips as shown in Figure 2.6. The specimen grips and connecting rods are fabricated from 718 Inconel to prevent elongation when heated in the furnace, and hold the specimen in a vertically aligned position. The lower specimen grips are similarly connected to an extension rod, a swageless thread terminal and a wire cable. Figure 2.6 shows a diagram of the details of the specimen grips. Appendix II contains CAD design drawings of the grip components, which includes the inner grips, collets, yolks, and rod connectors.
 	￼
Figure 2.6: Diagram of specimen grips 
		Completing the linkage, the wire cable is vertically secured to the bottom crossbeam of the steel frame in a 1/4-in diameter slot to allow for lateral movement and adjustments of up to 2 inches when a load is applied to the system and the cable is placed under tension. 
		Of special note is the horizontal position mark that is inscribed on the constant-stress cam prior to the system assembly. The cam is designed to produce a constant-stress about this centerline as shown in Figure 2.7, which aids in proper adjusting and positioning of the cam during calibration testing such that the rig functions as intended (refer to Calibration of rig section 2.3.3). 
￼

		The Squirrel data logger receives amplified voltage readouts from the ADT and LVDT. The output is sampled at five-second intervals and then logged as an average of five samples. This logging rate allows for long term creep tests to be conducted by decreasing the amount of data logger memory used, while ensuring the data collected has appropriate resolution for detailed data analysis. 

2.3.3	Calibration and Testing of rig
		A range of tests were performed on the creep rig to verify that the system functioned as intended. The machine was calibrated for use with a load of 35 MPa, and a series of tests were conducted to prove that the load on the test sample would be reduced at the specified rate to produce a constant-stress. 
		The Angular Displacement Transducer (ADT) output is a voltage, which is converted to an angular displacement in degrees. This rotational displacement value is used to calculate the elongation of the test specimen to a high degree of precision. The ADT displacement measurements required an adjustment factor to match the actual test specimen elongation. To conduct the test and acquire the adjustment factor, a sample test specimen was placed in the system and the effective load was decreased in 5 MPa increments by mechanically simulating a displacement of the specimen, which was accomplished by unscrewing the upper connecting rod out of the upper specimen grip connector. The data logger was used to record the angular displacement recorded by the ADT, and a micrometer was used to measure and record the simulated linear displacement. The test was conducted three times and the data was averaged. Figure 2.8 shows the results of this calibration. When the ADT results were adjusted with a factor of 3.156, the displacement values were identical to those taken with the micrometer, demonstrating that the displacement measuring system accurately measured and recorded specimen elongation.  
￼
	Figure 2.8: Plot of system displacement measurements taken with ADT, manually with a micrometer and the same ADT results plotted with an adjustment factor. Notice the adjusted ADT measurements match those taken with the micrometer. 
		A test was performed to determine if the connecting components of the system would creep under an applied load and affect the test results. A sample T-bone was fabricated from 718 Inconel and heat treated, which is the same material from which the specimen grips and connecting rods are fabricated. The sample was inserted into the specimen grips and the system put under a load of 35 MPa (the load used for subsequent sample testing). The system was tested for a 24 h duration. An initial displacement was recorded by the ADT within the first few seconds of the system coming under load, which can be attributed to the elimination of slack in the system. No creep of the system components was detected for the duration of the 24 h period, demonstrating that the only contributing factor to subsequent tests’ resulting creep was due to elongation of the T-bone specimens. 
		The furnace to heat the sample at a constant temperature was vertically aligned and therefore its temperature profile was measured to ensure that the temperature felt by the test specimen was indeed the temperature set point being measured by the K-type thermocouple. A second thermocouple was inserted along the inside length of the furnace and used to identify the location at which the measured temperature matched that being displayed as the set point on the furnace power control cabinet. This test was repeated three times and the results averaged with a final location determined to be 5.5 inches measured from the top of the furnace tube or 6.5 inches measured from the tube bottom exit. The system cables were adjusted accordingly to ensure that when under load, the test specimen would be located at the target height. 
		For a constant-stress test, the equation: 
			P/P0 = L0/L					(1)
where P is the load and L is the length of the specimen, must be satisfied for any angle and for any initial load P0 in order to satisfy the requirement that PL = constant. The creep rig was calibrated by comparing the theoretical predictions of equation (1) with experimental measurements of P and L. 
		Before beginning the calibration test, the cam was adjusted so the horizontal position mark inscribed on its side was level and at the intended zero mark. The furnace door was propped open to expose the specimen grips inside and a test specimen inserted. Steel balls with a total load 45 MPa were placed onto the loading tray. A zero reading was taken and recorded. The angle was increased in 5-degree increments, by mechanically simulating a displacement of the specimen, from 0 to 35 deg. For each interval, the load and linear displacement were recorded. Figure 2.9 shows the calibration plot. The experimental values had an average variation of 0.36 percent compared to the theoretically predicted values from equation (1). This value was well within the bounds of literature values { | Garofalo, et al., 1962 | | |zu:2902168:5TKQ6V7D} confirming the rig was calibrated and operational for constant-stress testing.

2.3.4	Testing Procedure 
		With the completion of calibration testing, creep test specimens were milled from the Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al model alloy as described in section 2.2.2 with the dimensions shown in Figure 2.10. Each specimen was homogenized for 24 h at 1250ºC as described in section 2.2.3 and subsequently heat-treated at 800ºC if required.  
￼
Figure 2.10: Dimensions of creep test specimen in millimeters. 
		Test specimens were inserted into the specimen grips and the furnace door locked. Glass wool was placed over the top and bottom furnace openings to reduce air currents and increase temperature uniformity. 4.015 kg were placed on the loading tray for a total load of 35 MPa, but not attached to the cam cable wire attachment loop. The cam was set so that the inscribed horizontal position mark was level and the furnace set to 760ºC. This temperature was chosen for all creep tests, because it matches the target application temperature for AFA stainless steels. Upon reaching the desired temperature, the weighted loading tray was hooked on the wire cable attachment loop and the system put into tension. When the loading tray stabilized within a few seconds, the data record button on the data logger would be pressed to begin data logging. Temperature was held constant in each test. 
		At 760ºC and under a 35 MPa load, it was established that the model alloy tested would enter the secondary creep regime approximately one hour after the specimen was put into tension by loading. It would remain at a steady state for at least a 750 h duration (the longest duration tested). To capture a representative sample of the creep curve, the duration of each test was 500 h, with the exception of two shorter partial tests conducted to evaluate microstructural changes at stages on the creep curve. 
		Upon completion of a test, data recording would be terminated, the system unloaded and the furnace ramped down to room temperature. The test specimen would then be removed from the specimen grips and sectioned into three parts using a diamond saw as described in section 2.2.2. Figure 2.11 shows the locations of where each section was located on the T-bone. Each section was imaged using scanning electron microscopy as detailed in the following section. These three locations were chosen to explore any differences in precipitate directionality visible during the microstructural analysis of each sample.

		Creep curves of strain percent over time were produced from the load and displacement data collected. Details about the heat treatments and each test’s duration can be found in the following chapter. 
	2.4	Materials Characterization
2.4.1	Scanning Electron Microscopy
		In preparation for imaging with the scanning electron microscope (SEM), samples were compression mounted and polished on a turntable using successively finer silicon carbide abrasive paper up to 1200-grit, then with 0.3 µm followed by a finer 0.05 µm alumina powder dissolved in water. Samples were placed on a polishing vibrometer with a thin layer of diluted MasterMet Colloidal Silica Polishing Suspension solution for ~3 h to eliminate surface defects and achieve a mirror finish. After the polishing was complete, the samples were washed with a spray of distilled water, then methanol, followed by a light scrubbing with a cotton swab and detergent to eliminate any adhered alumina particles. 
		Samples were imaged using a Tescan Vega3 SEM outfitted with Bruker Quantax Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) detectors. Samples were imaged using back-scattered electrons (BSE) with a working distance of 10 mm and operating voltage of 15 keV. 
2.4.2	Mechanical Testing
		Flat T-bones approximately 1 mm thick, with a gauge length of 15 mm, and width of 2 mm were machined from the model alloy as detailed in section 2.2.2 and homogenized at 1250ºC for 24 h. Specimens were heat treated at 760ºC for 0, 2.4, 24 or 240 h and inserted into high-temperature specimen grips of the Instron 5690 tensile testing machine coupled with a MTS hydraulic testing machine. The metal frame of the Instron supports the Mellen Inc. SCR Split Series 120 V 1200 W Furnace mounted vertically. The furnace utilizes clamshell-heating elements capable of 1250ºC in air. The temperature was measured with a centrally located K-type thermocouple and controlled by a Mellen Inc. PS105 programmable power control cabinet. 
		Elevated temperature tensile tests were conducted at 760ºC with an applied preload force of 50 N. For all tests the initial strain rate was 5 x 10-4 s-1, and each tensile test was performed three times for each heat treatment protocol. True strain (ɛ) and true stress (σ) were calculated from the load-displacement data and reported as true stress-strain curves. Percent elongation of the specimen was obtained by comparing the initial specimen gauge length and measuring the specimen gauge length after the tests were complete.
		Elevated temperature strain-rate jump tests were conducted at 760ºC, with an applied preload force of 50N prior to testing. The initial strain for all tests was 5 x 10-5 s-1. Each strain-rate jump was increased by an order of magnitude once a steady-state flow stress was obtained. The strain-rate jump test was performed three times for each specimen. True strain (ɛ) and true stress (σ) were calculated from the load-displacement data and reported as true stress-strain curves.</Text>

1. Introduction
The materials needed for energy applications have traditionally been those that maximize efficiency and decrease costs. Alumina- forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels have shown promise to decrease reliance on expensive Ni-base alloys for aggressive conditions in energy production and chemical processing environ- ments [1]. AFAs use alumina as a protective oxide scale for high corrosion resistance instead of chromia; alumina is known to offer even better protection than chromia at high temperatures [2,3]. AFA stainless steels were in development as early as the 70s [4] and more recently a new family of AFAs has been developed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) [1,5–8].
The newer grades of AFA stainless steels have an austenitic matrix, which provides better high-temperature creep strength than a b.c.c. matrix, and either MC or γ0-Ni3Al precipitates provide creep strengthening [1,7,8]. AFA stainless steels, which exist over a wide compositional range, have shown promising results but further study is needed to find the optimum combination of

abstract
The effect of aging on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of an alumina-forming austenitic stainless steel, Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al (at%) has been investigated. The alloy was fully solutionized after a 1250 1C, 24 h heat treatment, and the precipitation of B2 and Laves phases was studied after aging at 800 1C for up to 1325 h. While after 24 h the Laves phase precipitates in the matrix were 205 nm in diameter, they showed a further increase in diameter of only 50 nm even after aging for 1325 h. In contrast, the B2 precipitates in the matrix grew at a faster rate: after first being observed after aging for 24 h at an average diameter of 194 nm, they more than doubled in size from 330 to 734 nm as the aging time increased from 240 h to 1325 h. Both the Laves and B2 precipitates in the grain boundaries grew at a faster rate and were larger than matrix precipitates. The grain boundary coverage at 2.4 h (Laves 192 nm, NiAl 126 nm) was 56% with Laves phase initially making up the bulk of the precipitates, but after 2.4 h Laves phase and B2 precipitates alternated on the grain boundaries and total coverage reached 93% after 1325 h. An increase in the volume fraction of precipitates in the alloy was accompanied by an increase in the yield strength from 205 MPa after the solutionizing treatment up to 383 MPa after aging at 800 1C for 1325 h. After aging for 1325 h, even with extensive intermetallic grain boundary coverage, the alloy showed a room temperature elongation of 19%.

alloying elements that provide the most effective creep strength- eners at reasonable cost for commercialization [1]. Even within particular grades of AFAs, the influence of precipitate phases on creep strength is complex and a wide variety of creep strengths can be obtained with relatively small changes in alloying elements and phases [1,9,10].
Laves phase precipitates are potential candidates for strength- ening AFA stainless steels. The AB2-type Laves phase generally comes in one of three forms: hexagonal MgZn2 (C14), cubic MgCu2 (C15) or hexagonal MgNi2 (C36) [11]. Even though Laves phase has been shown to be harmful in some ferritic steels [12], decreasing their toughness and strength and precipitating at the grain boundaries, some research has indicated their potential for strengthening in both AFA stainless steels and alloys with similar compositions [7,10,13–16]. Use of the C14 Fe2Nb as a strengthener in an AFA steel is advantageous because it has a high melting temperature of 1641 1C, exists in equilibrium with f.c.c. γ-Fe to temperatures above 9551C [13,17], and has shown long-term stability at high temperatures [7,16–18]. Some previous studies have looked to Laves phase particles for strengthening in AFA-type alloys, but have only seen low or moderate improvements in creep resistance [7,16]. There was a slight improvement in creep resistance at 750 1C and 100 MPa in an AFA steel when the niobium content increased from 1 to 2 at% but the improvement
￼￼
was small when compared to the effect of increased carbon content. There was some dislocation pinning by coarse 500 nm size Fe2Nb precipitates and 10-nm size MC carbide precipitates but it was not clear whether the combination of precipitates was better than strengthening by MC carbide alone [16].
In the present work, the effects of heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of an alumina-forming austenitic stainless steel, Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al (at%) have been investigated. We show that, despite extensive intermetallic cover- age of the grain boundaries, surprisingly, the material was able to show both good ductility and strength.
2. Experimental
15.24 cm long, 2.54 cm diameter ingots of Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb– 5Al (at%) were arc melted followed by drop casting into a copper crucible, courtesy of Dr. Easo P. George at ORNL. The as-cast alloy was homogenized in argon for 24 h at 1250 1C and water quenched. This homogenization treatment produces a single phase material [19]. Samples were subsequently aged in air for 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h, 480 h and 1325 h at 800 1C.
A FEI XL-30 field emission gun (FEG) scanning electron micro- scope (SEM) operated at 15 kV and equipped with energy dis- persive spectroscopy (EDS) was used for microstructural analysis. Samples were prepared for SEM analysis by polishing with successively finer grits of silicon carbide paper, up to 1200 and with 0.3 and 0.05 mm alumina powder in a water to obtain a mirror finish. Backscattered electron (BSE) images from the speci- mens were processed using ImageJ [20] using a routine described in a previous paper [19] that uses Z-contrast to distinguish precipitates.
Transmission electron microscope (TEM) specimens were pre- pared by cutting discs out of samples that had been milled into 3 mm cylindrical rods. These discs were mechanically thinned and polished to $ 100 mm thick and electropolished using a Struers TenuPol-5 twin-jet electropolisher at a voltage of 11 V with a current of $ 180 mA using an electrolyte of 25% nitric acid in methanol at  20 1C. An EDS-equipped FEI Tecnai FS20ST FEG TEM operated at 200 kV was used to examine specimens.
Flat, dog-bone tensile specimens approximately 1.27 mm thick, with an overall length of 12.7 mm, and gauge length of 9.5 mm were prepared by milling followed by sectioning on a high-speed saw. The specimens were polished up to 1200-grit SiC paper and finished with 0.3 mm alumina powder to eliminate surface defects. Tensile tests were conducted in air at room temperature using an MTS at an initial strain rate of 5 10 4 s 1. Up to four tests were performed for each aging condition. Samples were preloaded to $150 N prior to testing. Percent elongation was determined from measurements of the specimens taken before and after fracture using an optical microscope. True strain (ε) and true stress (σ) were calculated from the load–displacement data and the work- hardening exponent was determined using the Hollomon equation [21]: σ1⁄4K(ε)n, where K is the strength coefficient that is equal to the true stress when ɛ1⁄41, and n is the strain-hardening exponent. This equation can be rewritten log(σ)1⁄4log(K)þn log(ε). Thus, by plotting log(σ) versus log(ε) for the uniform plastic deformation range, and fitting a straight line to the data, n can be determined from the slope, i.e. n1⁄4d log(σ)/d log(ε). For materials with inho- mogeneous yielding, the plastic portion is considered starting from the lower yield point.
Image analysis was performed previously on particles in this alloy system that were aged up to 240 h [19]. The analysis was extended to samples that had been aged for 1325 h. The particle nearest-neighbor distance, λ was determined for each aging condition
from the following equation [22]: λ 1⁄4 12 ð P A Þ   1 = 2
where PA is the particle density or point density and is equal to the particle count divided by the area of the image field of view [23]. Grain boundary coverage was calculated using BSE images. The percent coverage was found by subtracting segments of the grain boundary devoid of Laves and NiAl precipitates from the total grain boundary length and then dividing by the total grain boundary length.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was also performed on bulk samples using a Rigaku D/Max 2000 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ1⁄40.154059 nm) at 40 kV and 300 mA from 201 to 1201 with a step size of 0.011 with a count time of 1 s per step.
3. Results and discussion
After solutionizing at 1250 1C the alloy is single phase austenite (f.c.c.) and after aging at 800 1C both Laves and NiAl phases are present [19]. Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of the evolution of C14- type Fe2Nb and B2-ordered NiAl precipitates in the austenitic matrix after a 1250 1C, 24 h solution heat treatment and subse- quent aging at 800 1C for 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h, and 1325 h. X-ray peaks corresponding to C14 and B2 phases were not clearly visible until 24 and 240 h, respectively.
Fig. 2 shows BSE images of the microstructures after the 1250 1C solution heat treatment and after aging at 800 1C for 0.5 h, 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h, and 1325 h; the phase showing the light contrast is the C-14 type Fe2Nb and the darker phase is the B2- structured NiAl. These precipitates are common in AFAs [1,5,6,9,24–29]. Fig. 2(b) shows that precipitation of the Laves phase occurs on the grain boundaries even within 30 min at 800 1C. Fig. 2(c) shows that after aging for 2.4 h at 800 1C NiAl precipitation accompanies the Laves phase precipitation on the grain boundaries, however, the Laves phase precipitates make up a majority of the grain boundary precipitates and are coarser than the Laves phase precipitates in the grain interior. After aging for 24 h (Fig. 2(d)) the Laves and NiAl precipitates have increased in size in the matrix and the NiAl grain boundaries and the amount of NiAl on the grain boundaries is now similar to the extent of Laves phase coverage. Fig. 2(e) shows that at 240 h the NiAl precipitates have significantly increased in size in the matrix compared to the Laves phase, but on the grain boundaries the Laves and NiAl particles are comparable in size. After aging for 1325 h (Fig. 2(e)) larger Laves phase particles are present in the matrix, and the size of the NiAl particles has also increased. As the aging time

increased, a precipitation free zone (PFZ) becomes evident on the grain boundaries and increases in size. The formation of the precipitate free zone with longer aging is not surprising since the grain boundaries and matrix precipitates are made up of the same solute atoms [30]. In a 60 mm grain sized sample of Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al (at%) that was examined after creep-rupture testing at 750 1C and 100 MPa, a γ0-PFZ was formed that was postulated to have caused low creep-ductility. It was suggested that coarsening the grain size or using directional solidification to reduce the total grain boundary area might improve creep properties [7].

aging up to 240 h were reported in [19] and are duplicated in the Table. The Laves phase particles in the matrix after 24 h nearly doubled in size (205 nm) compared to the size at 2.4 h (95 nm). The Laves phase precipitates on the grain boundaries are 192 nm after aging for 2.4 h and show continued growth up to 743 nm after 1325 h. The NiAl particles are not visible in the matrix after 2.4 h, but appear on the grain boundaries (126 nm) and are slightly smaller than the Laves phase grain boundary precipitates (192 nm). Once NiAl precipitation is observed in the matrix at 24 h, the particle size continues to increase for aging times up to 1325 h: at 240 h the NiAl particle size (323 nm) is larger than that of the Laves phase (252 nm). At 240 h the grain boundary NiAl particles (366 nm) are also larger than the Laves phase particles on the grain boundaries (252 nm) and they continue to grow at a faster rate than the Laves phase grain boundary particles for aging up to 1325 h. After 1325 h the Laves phase particles showed growth to 301 nm in the matrix and the NiAl matrix particles had increased to 734 nm. In a Fe–20Cr–15Ni–5Al (at%) base alloy [16] the authors noted that after 2160 h at 800 1C there was not much change in the microstructure indicating good thermal stability. This thermal stability has also been noted after 2012 h at 750 1C in other AFA alloys [18].
Table 2 shows how the area fraction of grain boundary pre- cipitates changes with time. While there is no grain boundary coverage without aging, after 2.4 h there is 56% grain boundary coverage. There is much more variability in grain boundary cover- age after aging at 2.4 h. There is significant grain boundary coverage of 78% after 24 h and 84% after 240 h. After 1325 h the grain

boundary was almost completely saturated with 93% coverage. At the early stages of aging, the amount of grain boundary precipitation significantly varies depending on the grain boundary misorientation. This is consistent with Denham and Silcock's observation that the size and density of the Fe2Nb precipitates can show variations based on the crystallography of the grain boundary [31]. In the present alloy, as the grain boundary pre- cipitates grew in size as the sample was aged, the boundaries that had less coverage initially were able to ‘catch up’ which led to increased grain boundary coverage as the sample was aged.
Fig. 3(a) is a bright field TEM image showing dislocations surrounding the Laves phase precipitates. Dislocations can be punched out due to the strains arising from the difference in the thermal expansion between the precipitate and matrix. The dislocations formed from the precipitation of the Laves phase then act as sites for further Laves phase precipitation and can result in the formation of stringers [30]. Evidence of precipitation in this manner is visible in the BSE image shown in Fig. 3(b) where in one grain, there are lines of precipitates that have presumably precipitated on punched out dislocations. The strain contrast that is present in TEM images of Fe2Nb that has precipitated in austenite in Fe–20Cr–35Ni–2Nb and Fe–20Cr–25Ni–2Nb (at%) after aging at 800 1C [17] is indicative of a semi-coherent pre- cipitate-matrix interface and may be a reason why the Laves phase has shown stability during aging and creep testing at 800 1C [32]. If the precipitate had a different crystal structure than the matrix it would be expected to form a needle-like or disk-like nucleus [33].
Tensile testing showed that the strength and ductility of the alloy was strongly influenced by the aging time and, hence, the formation and coarsening of the precipitates. Increasing the aging time led to an increase in tensile strength, but a decrease in ductility, see Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows BSE images of the fracture surfaces after tensile testing, which all displayed dimple-type ductile rupture irrespective of the measured elongations. The trends of decreased ductility and improved strength with ageing observed here have been noted in other AFA alloys aged at 750 1C [18]. In AFA alloys with base composition Fe–(11.90–14.24)Cr–1.93Mn– (20.10–25.24)Ni–(0.47–0.48)Cu–(2.87–3.91)Al–14Si–(1.01–1.00)Nb– (2–2.01)Mo–(1–0.99)W (wt%) yield strength and ultimate tensile strength reached maximum values (400–450 and 890–930 MPa respectively) after 50 or 500 h aging and the yield strength did not show much change, while the ultimate tensile strength slightly decreased. Among the AFA alloys tested, elongation continuously decreased with aging regardless of composition [18]. In contrast to

other heat treatment conditions, the tensile test curves after aging for 2.4 h were discontinuous and showed an upper and lower yield point with a Lüder's strain of 5%. This yield-point phenomenon has been studied extensively in steels and is known to occur when dislocations quickly multiply and the average dislocation velocity decreases along with the stress needed to move dislocations [34– 36]. A summary of the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation for each aging condition is presented in Section 2. When an upper and lower yield strength was observed, the lower yield strength is presented.
Figs. 6 and 7 show representative plots of the strain hardening exponent fit for the different aging conditions. The n value can range from 0 to 1 with typical values being from 0.1 to 0.6 [37]. In Fig. 6 the double logarithmic plot of the true stress and true strain for the solutionized alloy did not show a good straight line fit, while linear fits with R2 values close to 1 were obtained for aging times of 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h and 1325 h (Fig. 7), i.e. except for the as- solutionized alloy, all the other specimens could be well described by the Hollomon equation. Hollomon noted that there were cases where the log–log plots of stress and strain can curve upward, especially for larger strains, suggesting anisotropy [21]. The homogenized, non-aged alloy showed the largest elongation. Fig. 6 shows that this alloy displayed two-stage work hardening also known as ‘double n’ behavior. The curve is deconvoluted to show two stages of work-hardening with the first curve showing a small n-value of 0.18 followed by a second stage showing a high n value of 0.70. The representative log–log plots in Fig. 7 for samples aged at 2.4h, 24h, 240h and 1325h show a good match to the Holloman equation all with R2 values of 0.99. Samples aged at

2.4 h showed the highest work-hardening exponent with n 1⁄4 0.62. This is most likely due to the effects of discontinuous yielding. The n value for steels typically decreases with increasing strength. The highest possible n value of a steel is when its strength is the lowest and n tends to increase with elongation [38]. In the present study, n-values after aging at 24 h, 240 h and 1325 h were $0.3. The strain hardening values are summarized in Table 2.
Fig. 8 shows a linear fit to a plot of the inverse mean surface-to- surface interparticle spacing versus the yield strength, which produces the equation σy (MPa)1⁄474λ 1þ202 where λ is the mean interparticle spacing. The predicted value of the yield strength from this equation without any particles at 202 MPa is closely similar to the experimentally-measured value of 205 MPa. The result is indicative of a looping mechanism of particle strengthening. An Orowan looping-based mechanism would make sense for the Laves phase precipitates because they are hard and brittle and would act as a barrier to dislocation motion [18]. The model does not, however, completely capture the results obtained. The largest YS and UTS were observed after 1325 h, not after 24 h when the smallest interparticle spacing was observed.
It is possible that the greater grain boundary coverage at 1325 h is what caused the alloy to show both higher yield and tensile strength even as the matrix particles coarsened and the inter- particle distance increased. Tarigan et al. reported that creep life was extended without ductility loss even with increased Laves phase grain boundary precipitation in Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb (at%) [14,15] and called the strengthening mechanism a “grain boun- dary precipitation strengthening mechanism” (GBPS) which they

when over 78% of the grain boundaries were covered with precipitates, in spite of a decreased interparticle distance, the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength showed a relatively small increase up to the 1325 h aging time, compared to the initial increase in strength from the precipitation observed at 2.4 h. The 93% grain boundary coverage at 1325 h, coupled with the more than doubling and tripling of grain boundary precipitate size at 24 h for the Laves and NiAl, respectively led ductility to decrease by $1/3.
Even with the grain boundaries being nearly completely saturated with precipitates of brittle phases, the alloy had ductility of 19% after 1325 h. If the two phases are relatively coherent with the grain boundary, it would be expected that a favorable combination of creep and ductility could be attained [39]. For example, data from Keown and Pickering's on AISI type 347 stainless steels in 1974 [40] suggested that the Fe2Nb on grain boundaries might have improved creep ductility, but Kestenbach and Bueno [39] presented evidence that disproved this. They also cited that Fe2Nb precipitation caused decreased ductility in the high temperature tensile tests performed by Denhan and Silcock [31]. However, in Bei et al.'s more recent study of AFAs, even though the ductility decreased with aging, it was still 10–15% in room temperature tensile tests after aging for 2012 h, even though there was extensive grain boundary coverage of both NiAl and Laves phases [18]. Tarigan et al. [14,15] observed that even with 89% grain boundary coverage by the Laves phase precipitates a creep rupture strain of 77% was attained which suggests that Laves phase grain boundary precipitates do not necessarily lead to deleterious embrittlement. The most often cited Laves phase

proposed was caused by decreased grain boundary deformation in sections of the grain boundary covered by the Laves phase. In Chen et al.'s study of Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–0.03B (at%) it was also con- cluded that precipitation of the Laves phase on the grain bound- aries enhanced creep resistance [10]. These alloys did not include additions of Al so instead of just Laves phase, both Laves and NiAl precipitates are present on the matrix and grain boundary. Con- sistent with the results involving creep, the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength maximum at 1325 h in Fe–20Cr–30Ni– 2Nb–5Al (at%) reflects the condition of maximum grain boundary coverage, indicating that the increased grain boundary precipita- tion acted as a more effective barrier to dislocations.

orientation relationship with austenite achieves a 5% contraction of the matrix in the [111] direction and 9% expansion in the [112] direction [31] which represents a moderate misfit when compared to high misfit particles such as niobium carbonitride ( $ 23% mismatch with the austenite matrix [41]) which can reduce creep ductility. In an Fe–Ni–Cr–Al (FNCA) alloy with a similar base composition to the alloy in the present study that did not include niobium, two variants of the Kurdjmov–Sachs relationship were found for NiAl [42]. If present in this alloy, this relationship might achieve a misfit with the matrix that would encourage ductility despite extensive grain boundary precipitation. If the more oft observed orientation relationships for NiAl and Laves phases are consistent for Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al (at%), this may explain why the coverage of the grain boundaries with these brittle precipitates might lead to sufficient ductility.
4. Summary
The microstructural and mechanical response to aging Fe– 20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al (at%) at 800 1C after a 1250 1C solution heat treatment was studied. With aging the Laves phase particles at first grew rapidly in the matrix and after 24 h showed steady growth to 301 nm after 1325 h. The NiAl matrix particles after 24 h were only 90 nm at the 24 h time interval and grew relatively quickly up to 734 nm after 1325 h. Both Laves and NiAl particles grew substantially on the grain boundaries and more than doubled in size as the sample was aged from 240 to 1325 h.
Tensile tests were performed and the strain-hardening exponent generally showed a good fit to the Holloman equation. The unaged alloy showed two-stage work hardening. When the alloy was aged at 2.4 h an upper and lower yield point was observed. Improved strength was observed with increased grain boundary precipitation as the sample was aged, reaching a maximum of 383 MPa at 1325 h even though the interparticle spacing decreased.
Even as the grain boundary precipitate coverage increased to 93% after 1325 h the alloy showed room temperature elongation of 19%. It was hypothesized that the ductility in the alloy may be related to the low-misfits of the precipitates with the austenite matrix.

Orientation relationships of Laves phase and NiAl particles in an AFA stainless steel

(Received 17 June 2015; accepted 18 October 2015)
The alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steel, Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb– 5Al (in at. %) was solutionized at 1250 °C in order to obtain a fully austenitic microstructure and then aged for up to 1325 h at 800 °C to precipitate the Laves phase and B2-NiAl particles typically found in AFAs. This paper describes detailed analyses of the orientation relationships between these parti- cles and the matrix which were determined by transmission electron micro- scopy. Four variants of the (1 1 1)m//(0 0 0 1)p, 1⁄2"1 1 0 m//1⁄21 0 "1 0 p orientation relationship proposed by Denham and Silcock (J. Iron Steel Inst. 207 (1969) p.582) were observed for the Laves phase, and six variants of the (111)m// (0 1 1)p, 1⁄2"1 0 1 m//1⁄21 1 1 p Kurdjumov–Sachs relationship were observed for the B2-NiAl phase.
Keywords: Precipitate-orientation relationship; transmission electron micro- scopy; austenite; intermetallics; Laves phase
Introduction
Alumina (Al2O3)-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels have shown potential to decrease reliance on expensive Ni-based alloys for aggressive environments in energy production and chemical processing environments [1]. AFAs use alumina as a protective oxide scale for high corrosion resistance since alumina is known to offer even better protection than chromia at high temperatures [2,3]. AFA stainless steels were in devel- opment as early as the 1970s [4] and more recently AFAs have received renewed atten- tion for their promising materials properties [1,5–21].
Within particular grades of AFAs, the influence of precipitate phases on creep strength is complex. A wide variety of creep strengths can be obtained with relatively small changes in alloying elements. Phases that are beneficial in some AFAs cause decreased creep strength in others. The Laves phase, for example, having shown long- term stability at high temperatures [7,9,15,22], has been investigated for its ability to act as a strengthener [7,9,18,20,21]. Along with the Laves phase, the role of B2-NiAl particles in AFAs has been investigated. B2-NiAl particles have been shown to act as strengtheners in room temperature tensile tests in AFA alloys, but have not shown any strengthening effect at 750 °C due to the brittle-to-ductile transition common to B2 intermetallic compounds [15]. The B2 particles support the formation of the alumina layer in AFAs by acting as an Al reservoir [13,15].

The Laves phase has an AB2 stoichiometry and can exist as three closely related structures C14, C15 and C36. C15 (MgCu2, Fd"3m) is the cubic form of the Laves phase, C14 is a hexagonal structure (MgZn2, P63/mmc) and C36 which is also hexagonal (MgNi2, P63/mmc). Identification of the specific structure prevalent for an alloy system can vary with composition and heat treatment [23]. In some instances dif- ferent structures are present in a given alloy [24] or one structure transforms into another [25–27]. Two crystal structures can often be present in a single particle [25,28]. The C14-type Fe2Nb Laves phase that has been observed in studies of AFAs and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images typically has a plate-like morphology.
The B2-NiAl phase has CsCl crystal structure, space group Pm"3m. B2 particles are spherical in some materials such as precipitation-hardenable martensitic stainless steels [29] and have also shown plate-like morphology in Fe–Ni–Cr–Al (FNCA) alloys [30,31]. There are few observations of diffraction patterns with the Laves phase being compared along with its parent matrix. While extensive work has been done recently by Bhowmik and coworkers [32–37] and Kumar and coworkers in the past [24,25,38–40] in under- standing Cr2Ta Laves phase structures and polymorphs, observed in Cr–Ta alloys, the Fe2Nb Laves phase has received comparatively very little attention. As noted in [23] there are not many clear diffraction patterns in the literature depicting the Laves phase in stain- less steel. In this study, both Laves phase and B2-NiAl particles were formed from ageing a solutionized, single-phase f.c.c. matrix of Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al, with the objective of determining the crystallographic relation between the f.c.c. matrix and the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates via transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations.
Experimental
Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al (at. %) was cast into 15.24-cm long, 2.54-cm diameter ingots by vacuum arc-melting followed by drop casting into a copper crucible, courtesy of Dr Easo P. George. After casting the alloy was homogenized for 24 h at 1250 °C. The alloy was then aged at 800 °C for up to 1325 h [18]. An FEI XL30 SEM operated at 15 kV was used to observe microstructural features. Samples for the SEM were ground using silicon carbide papers up to 1200 grit and polished to a mirror finish using 0.3 and 0.05 μm alumina powder in water. Specimens for TEM observation were cut into rectangular bars that were milled into 3-mm diameter cylinders. The cylinders were cut into 3-mm discs and polished to ~150 μm thick. The thin foils were then twin jet elec- tropolished in a solution of 25% nitric acid in methanol using a Struers Tenupol 5 at a voltage of 11 V and current of 100 mA at −20 °C. Microstructural examination of the specimens was performed using a Tecnai F20 FEG TEM operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 keV and equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).
Experimental selected area diffraction patterns (SADPs) were simulated using CrystalMaker® 9.1.3 and SingleCrystal® 2.3.1 software. The lattice parameters used to simulate SAD patterns for the matrix (a = 0.361 nm), Laves phase particles (a = 0.482 nm, c = 0.784 nm) and NiAl particles (a = 0.289 nm) were determined from X-ray diffraction from [18]. The value for the Laves phase is comparable to that obtained for (Fe, Cr, Ni)2(Nb, Si) Laves particles (a = 0.476 nm and c = 0.786 nm) in a Fe–15Cr–15Ni–Nb (wt. %) austenitic stainless steel that had additions of Si and other alloying elements [41]. Without 2 wt. % niobium the alloy had a matrix lattice parame- ter of a = 0.3549 nm, and with niobium the austenite lattice expanded to 0.3556 nm

[41]. A study of deformation behaviour in an AFA steel used a similar lattice parameter of 0.361 nm for the f.c.c. matrix [20]. The Laves lattice parameter noted in this study also falls within the range found in a study of Fe–Ni–Nb, by Takeyama et al. [42] and Denham and Silcock [43]. The lattice parameter of stoichiometric B2-NiAl was reported to be 0.28864 nm [44] and the lattice parameters of Ni-(42-55)Al has been shown to fall in the range of 0.287–0.289 nm [45].
Results and discussion
Overview of precipitates
Laves phase and B2-NiAl particles in Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al typically appear to grow in distinct directions [7,18,19]. Figure 1 shows SEM backscattered electron (BSE) images of Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al after both solution treatment and a series of ageing treatments at 800 °C. In Figure 1(a), the alloy shows no evidence of precipitation and is single-phase f.c.c. After ageing at 800 °C for 24 h Laves phase particles showing bright contrast have precipitated uniformly in the matrix with a few (dark) B2-NiAl particles present (Figure 1(b)). Three lines are drawn on the image parallel to the long axis of the particles and a circle is drawn for the particles that appear to project out of the image. The Laves phase particles appear to grow in only four directions. In Figure 1(c), the BSE allows one to clearly see the larger, darker contrast B2-NiAl particles that are present at 240 h, which in some instances have grown to be much larger than the Laves phase precipitates. In Figure 1(d), unlike at earlier times, after ageing at 1325 h all NiAl particles that are visible in the matrix are much larger than the Laves phase particles in the matrix. Four lines are drawn on the image parallel to the NiAl particles, suggesting there are at least four growth directions for the NiAl particles.

TEM–EDS results from the particles and matrix are presented in Table 1. The aver- age matrix composition after ageing at 800 °C for 1325 h has decreased amounts of Cr, Ni and Nb, and increased amounts of Fe and Al as compared to the nominal alloy com- position. The B2-NiAl particles primarily consist of Ni (49.9 at. %) and Al (38.1 at. %) with substantial amounts of Fe (9.2 at. %). The values obtained for the B2-NiAl ((Ni, Fe)Al) particles are consistent with the B2-NiAl particle composition observed in a martensitic precipitation hardenable steel where atom probe data also showed a lower Al content and an incorporation of Fe while the Ni content was at 50 at. % [46]. The Fe2Nb ((Fe, Cr, Ni)2Nb) Laves phase particles consisted primarily of Fe (40.3 at. %), Cr (14.2 at. %), Ni (15.4 at. %) and Nb (28 at. %). Similar compositions for Fe2Nb Laves particles were observed by the author [19] and in other works [41,42,47,48]. For example, in a study of the alloy Fe–15Nb–40Ni (at. %) the Laves phase had a composi- tion of Fe-27 at. % Nb-33 at. % Ni [47] and a study of Fe–16.2Cr–14.3Ni–1.2Nb (at. %) [41] described (Fe, Ni, Cr)2(Nb, Si) particles with a composition of Fe–12.6Ni– 11.3Cr–22.9Nb–6.8Si (at. %), indicating a consistency in how the ‘A’ and ‘B’ elements that contribute to the AB2 Laves phase are proportioned.
Laves phase crystal structure and orientation relationship
There are six fundamental four-layer stacking schemes that can be combined to form Laves phase as described by Komura [49] and two four-layer schemes make up the C14 structure. The C14 phase has 12 atoms per unit cell. The stacking of the C14 structure along the (0001) planes is similar to the ...ABAB... stacking sequence observed in hcp structures [50]. There are a number of ways to describe the stacking sequence. For example, as described by Komura [49], the two layers form in the close- packed direction and follow an ...AB′AB′... pattern, described as: αAαcßBßc... where αAαc represents the ‘A’ and ßBßc represents the ‘B’ [51]. Greek letters correspond to large atoms (Nb in Fe2Nb) and Roman letters correspond to smaller atoms (Fe). Figure 2(a) shows a C14 Laves projection onto a (0 0 0 1) plane. Depending on which atoms are chosen to occupy the corner sites of a unit cell, different descriptions of the stacking constructions can be used. For example, Chen et al. [52] describes the AB2 C14 structure with small ‘B’ atoms making up the corners of the unit cell (Figure 2(b)) and consisting of two blocks, B1 and B1′ containing a series of primed and unprimed planes that are twin related Figure 2(c). Figure 2(d) shows the typical representation of a C14 unit cell. Kumar and Hazzledine [24] have an alternate description of the C14 stacking sequence where large atoms occupy the corners of a unit cell (Figure 2(e)). The Laves structure is described as a construction of XY′ quadruple layers which are

The orientation relationship between the Laves phase particles and the matrix was investigated via tilting experiments in the TEM. A bright-field image of a hexagonally shaped Laves phase precipitate in the f.c.c. matrix is shown in Figure 3(a). Figure 3(b) and (c) show kikuchi patterns taken from the matrix and a Laves phase precipitate, respectively. Figure 3(d) shows a SADP of the precipitate and matrix. A schematic rep- resentation of the SADP with indexing is shown in Figure 3(e). The six-fold symmetry in Figure 3(e) is consistent with the basal plane of the Laves phase (hexagonal (C14), P63/mmc). The Laves phase precipitate was oriented along the [0 0 0 1] direction while the matrix was at [111]. Based on the diffraction patterns, and simulated results, the orientation relationship between the Fe2Nb precipitate and the austenite matrix for this particle was confirmed to be:
ð0 0 0 1ÞFe2Nb==ð1 1 1Þc 1⁄21 0 "1 0 Fe2Nb==1⁄2"1 1 0 c
This is the relationship observed by Denham and Silcock [43] for Laves phase precipi- tates in an f.c.c. alloy with Fe, Cr, Ni, Nb and other minor constituents, and also in a Fe–16.2Cr–14.3Ni–1.2Nb (at. %) alloy with minor alloying additions [41]. The Laves phase precipitate has the close-packed basal (0 0 0 1) planes parallel to the close-packed (111) matrix planes that exhibit three-fold symmetry and a hexagonal pattern. While many particles were observed with the above orientation, a number of variants were observed, which was expected from the observation of particles SEM images (Figure 1).
In Figure 4(a), a TEM bright-field image of an elongated Laves particle is shown. A SADP of the particle is shown in Figure 4(b) and the simulated matrix/Laves particle

The bright-field image in Figure 5 shows Laves phase/matrix-orientation variants. The Laves phase particles labelled with a ‘1’ and a ‘2’ are analysed. Laves phase parti- cles labelled with a ‘(1)’ or a ‘(2)’ have the same orientation relationships of particles ‘1’ and ‘2’, respectively. The SADP in Figure 5(b) is taken from precipitate ‘1’ and the SADP in Figure 5(c) is taken from precipitate ‘2’. In both SADPs the f.c.c. matrix is at viewed along the [1 0 1] zone axis. Figure 5(d) and (e) shows a representation of the superimposed electron diffraction patterns from both the matrix and the two particles with both particles being viewed along their 1⁄20 "1 1 0  zone axis. Tilting experiments and the correspondence between the image and the electron diffraction pattern of the parti- cles, revealed that the particle whose SADP is shown in Figure 5(b) has an orientation of ð"1 1 1Þm//(0 0 0 1)p, 1⁄20 1 "1 m//1⁄21 0 "1 0 p and that shown in Figure 5(c) has an orientation of ð111Þm//(0001)p, [011]m//1⁄210"10 p. These particles grow along the matrix {111} planes (ð"1 1 1Þ in Figure 5(d) and ð1 1 1Þ in Figure 5(e)). The particle shown in Figure 5(c) has the same orientation relationship as the particle presented in Figure 4. Both of these particles have similar morphologies and their long axis pointing along the same direction.
In Figure 6 a fourth variant of the orientation relationship between the matrix and the Laves phase is observed. Figure 6(a) shows a TEM bright-field image with an elon- gated Laves phase precipitate labelled ‘1’. The particle labelled ‘(1)’ was also found to have the same orientation as particle ‘1’.

Based on the observation that for any given particle, the Laves phase {0 0 0 1} close- packed planes tend to align with the {111} close-packed planes of the matrix, it can be predicted that considering symmetry, the four {1 1 1} planes in the f.c.c. matrix, and the three 〈110〉 directions within each {111} plane, up to 12 variants of the Laves phase and matrix-orientation relationship might be observed in TEM studies (Table 2).
Figure 7 shows the superimposed stereographic projection of the Laves phase and matrix orientations. Since for directions of type 〈0 0 0 1〉 and 〈h k i 0〉 plane normal and directions have the same indices, only these directions are plotted on the stereograph.

{10"10} and {11"20} refer to prism planes of type I and type II, respectively [53]. Figure 7(a–d) shows the stereographic projections of the four variants described above with Laves phase (0001) traces. The Laves phase {0001} traces overlap with the matrix {1 1 1} traces.
Particles with a hexagonal shape had the first orientation described above, while those that were more elongated and often plate-like and faceted are seen to grow along the other matrix {111} directions. The calculated diffraction patterns of Figures 4(c), 5(d, e) and 6(c), {0001} Laves and {111} matrix planes are in close proximity to one another, and taken alone, this would suggest that these planes are nearly parallel and that 〈1 1 1〉 are preferred directions for precipitate growth.
This observed orientation, according to Denham and Silcock is thought to be governed
by the Fe and Nb containing A-layer of the Fe2Nb (AB2) and the attainment of the same
atomic site densities for the matrix and precipitate [43]. In their description of the Laves
Fe2Nb structure, Fe atoms occupy the corner sites of the C14 unit cell. The stacking
sequence along the ‘c’ axis is described as ABAB (Figure 8(a)), and the A layer is a puck-
ered layer that consists of Nb and Fe with the Nb atoms at ` 1 z, while the B layer con- 16
tains Fe atoms (Figure 8(b)) [43]. The first layer of atoms that make up the basal plane of the Laves phase is coherent with the (1 1 1) matrix plane (Figure 8(c)) which results in a favourably small mismatch in lattice spacing. In their analysis, Denham and Silcock note that if a different orientation relationship occurred where the B layer of iron atoms were coherent instead, the density of atomic sites in the expanded matrix lattice would be 33% greater than in the observed orientation, which leads to the conclusion that it is the density relationship as well as the niobium atoms’ role in nucleation at the reaction front that are the major factors that cause the orientation that is observed. Following the analysis in [43], given the above orientation relationship the f.c.c. matrix contracts by 6% in the 〈1 1 1〉 direction and expands by 9% in the 〈1 1 2〉 direction and the volume expansion on transformation from matrix to precipitate is 12%. As noted by [54] others have successfully concluded the preferred direction of precipitate growth following this methodology, but this is not always an accurate assumption.

[18] and much like in [43] the Laves phase in the orientation relationship that has been observed was determined to have only a moderate misfit with the austenite matrix. This may help to explain why this alloy has been shown to have room temperature ductility despite the presence of these brittle precipitates.
NiAl and matrix-orientation relationship
Figure 9(a) shows a bright-field TEM image of a B2-NiAl particle. Figure 9(b) and (c) show a SADP taken from the NiAl particle and matrix, respectively. In Figure 9(b), the particle is tilted to [0 1 1] and the matrix in coincident [1 1 1] in Figure 9(c). Figure 9(d) is a schematic of a superimposed diffraction pattern of both the particle and matrix. From the diffraction pattern the particle was concluded to have a (111)m//(011)p,

1⁄2"1 0 1 m//1⁄21 1 1 p orientation relationship, which is consistent with the Kurdjumov–Sachs- orientation relationship.
Figure 10 shows bright-field TEM images of additional B2-NiAl particles exhibiting different Kurdjumov–Sachs-orientation variants determined via tilting experiments in the TEM. In Figure 10(a), one additional NiAl particle Kurdjumov–Sachs variant is observed (to the right of the particle from Figure 9). It was determined to have the ori- entation relationship ð"111Þm//(011)p, [101]m//1⁄2111 p. In Figure 10(b), two B2-NiAl particles and shown with ð1"11Þm//(011)p, [110]m//1⁄2111 p, and ð111Þm//(011)p, [01 1]m//1⁄2"1 1 "1 p variants of the Kurdjumov–Sachs relationship.
Unlike with the Laves phase, NiAl particles that appeared to be oriented similarly in bright-field TEM images were observed to occasionally represent different variants of the K–S relationship. For example, Figure 11 shows an analysis of two nearly side- by-side B2-NiAl particles in the matrix. Figure 11(a) is a bright-field TEM image of the two particles in the matrix. Figure 11(b) shows a diffraction from the matrix down the [3 2 3] zone axis. Figure 11(c) and (d) show the diffraction patterns from the two NiAl particles while the matrix is at the [3 2 3] axis. Figure 11(e) and (f) show the simulated diffraction patterns of the two particles. Though the particles appear to be oriented in the same direction based on the TEM bright-field image, their respective diffraction pat- terns reveal that they are two distinct twin-related variants of the K–S relationship hav- ing orientations of ð1"11Þm//(011)p, 1⁄210"1 m//1⁄2111 p, and ð1"11Þm//(011)p, 1⁄210"1 m// 1⁄2"1 1 "1 p, respectively.
In studies of the morphology and crystallography of martensite in steels a total of 24 (V1–V24) possible variants have been predicted for the K–S relationship [55–57]. Figure 12 shows the superimposed stereographic projections of the matrix and B2-NiAl particles that have the K–S relationship. {111} and {011} matrix and precipitate planes are plotted on the stereographic projections. In this study, a total of six of the 24 K–S variants were observed:

￼￼￼￼￼Others have noted K–S variants and theory suggest that the lattice parameter value plays an important role in the determination of the preferred orientation observed in f.c.c./b.c.c. systems. The K–S-orientation relationship has been seen in an FNCA alloy [30,31] with B2-NiAl precipitates that also had a plate-like morphology. In that case, two K–S-orientation relationship variants were observed. In a study of f.c.c. Co precipi- tates in a B2-ordered (Ni, Co)Al alloy [58], three variants of the K–S-orientation rela- tionship were observed and it was noted that the ratio of the lattice parameters of the

f.c.c and b.c.c. phase can influence the orientation relationship. In [54] it was predicted that b.c.c. and f.c.c. systems have a lattice parameter ratio between 1.21 and 1.36 would have the K–S relationship. Given the value of 1.25 for the lattice parameter ratio between the f.c.c. matrix and the B2-NiAl in this alloy, it is not surprising that Kx2013; S-orientation is observed for the NiAl precipitates.
Conclusions
Hexagonal-shaped and elongated Fe2Nb-type Laves phase, and plate-like B2-NiAl pre- cipitates were observed after a solution anneal at 1250 °C followed by ageing at 800 °C in Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al. The orientation between the f.c.c. matrix and Laves phase was determined to have the (1 1 1)m//(0 0 0 1)p, 1⁄2"1 1 0 m//1⁄21 0 "1 0 p orientation relationship proposed by Denham and Silcock. The B2-NiAl precipitates were determined to have a Kurdjumov–Sachs-orientation relationship with the matrix, i.e. (1 1 1)m//(0 1 1)p, 1⁄2"101 m//1⁄2111 p. While the Laves phase particles primarily followed four variants, six variants of the K–S-orientation were observed for the B2-NiAl particles.

abstract
Two different thermo-mechanical treatments (TMT) were performed on an alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steel, DAFA 29, which was recently developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for ap- plication in advanced ultra supercritical power plants. The resulting fine-grained TMT materials showed yield stresses more than double the yield stress of the as-received material at room temperature and more than 50% higher at 600 oC, but lower yield stresses (but greater elongations) at 700 oC and above. Strain rate jump tests performed at both 600 oC and 700 oC showed that the TMT materials have greater strain rate sensitivity and lower activation volumes at both temperatures. The strain rate has a power law relationship with the flow stress with a stress exponent of $5. The as-received AFA alloy showed ser- rated stress–strain curves at 600 oC suggesting the occurrence of dynamic strain aging.

38 An effective way to enhance the energy conversion efficiency
39 and reduce the carbon footprint of fossil fuel power plants is to
40 increase their operating temperature and pressure. The operating
41 temperature and pressure of current ultra-supercritical (USC)
42 power plants are 600 oC/25 MPa which will eventually increase to
43 700 oC/35 MPa and then later to 760 oC/35 MPa for the next gen-
44 eration of advanced ultra-supercritical (A-USC) power plants [1–
45 4]. The materials used for boiler/steam turbine in the A-USC power
46 plant must be able to withstand not only this high operating
47 temperature, but also excellent oxidation and corrosion resistance,

Recently-developed AFA stainless steels exhibit the promising mechanical properties and oxidation resistance [8–14]. These AFA
alloys fall in the composition ranges Fe–(12–35)Ni–(12–15)Cr– 74

room temperature. The TMTs reduced the grain size significantly to the nanoscale ($100 nm) and increased the room temperature yield strength to above 1000 MPa [15].
In this paper, the deformation behavior of this AFA alloy in both the as-received condition and after the TMTs was studied at ele- vated temperatures. The flow stress of the TMT materials was evaluated at different strain rates, and the high temperature de- formation mechanisms were characterized.

5 The DAFA29 used in this study was obtained from ORNL (Oak
6 Ridge, TN). Ingots of the alloys had been hot-rolled at 1100 oC (80%
7 thickness reduction with $15–20% thickness reduction per pass)
8 and then annealed at 1100 oC for 30 min in Arþ4% H2 gas, fol-
9 lowed by air-cooling. The chemical composition of this alloy, as
10 analyzed using inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and gas
11 combustion techniques at ORNL, is shown in Table 1.
12 Two TMTs of the DAFA29 were performed in an attempt to
13 produce finer and uniformly distributed precipitates [15]. In the
14 first approach (referred to as Method #1), the DAFA29 was cold
15 rolled to a 90% reduction in thickness with a $4.5% reduction per
16 pass, and then annealed at 800 oC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h. The grain
17 sizes of the thermomechanically treated alloys ranged from
18 $100 nm to $1 mm depending on different annealing time. In the
19 second approach (referred to as Method #2), the alloy was given a
20 solutionizing anneal at 1200 oC and then cold rolled to a 90 % re-
21 duction in thickness with a $4.5% reduction per pass before an-
22 nealing at 800 oC for 2.4, 24, or 240 h. As the annealing time was
23 increased from 2.4 to 240h, the grain size increased from
24 $200 nm to $2 mm. The as-received DAFA29 has a grain size of
25 $ 40 mm with niobium enriched precipitates ( $ 10 mm) randomly
26 distributed in the matrix and grain boundaries. After TMT, finer
27 and uniformly distributed precipitates ( $ 560 nm) are present.
28 Details of the microstructures of these thermo-mechanical treat-
29 ments were described in a previous paper [15].

31 2.2. Mechanical testing 32
33 Tensile test specimens were milled to dog-bone geometry with
34 a gauge length of 10 mm, width of 2.65 mm, thickness of 0.8 mm,
35 and polished to a mirror finish using 800 grit silicon carbide pa-
36 pers followed by 0.3 μm alumina powder.
37 Elevated temperature (600 oC, 700 oC and 800 oC) tensile tests
38 were performed with an Instron 5690 tensile testing machine and
39 a MTS hydraulic testing machine. A preload force of 50 N was
40 applied before the tensile tests. The initial strain rate for all tensile
41 tests was 5 10  4 s  1. Elongations were measured directly from
42 the gauge of the specimens after the tensile tests. All the tensile
43 tests were performed three times for each specimen. The resulting
44 test data are shown as true stress–true strain curves.
45 Strain rate jump tests were performed on the same tensile test
46 machine at 600 oC and 700 oC. A preload force of 50 N was again

The polished samples were polished with a vib- 75 rometer (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL) for 3 h. The specimens were then 76 examined in an FEI XL-30 field emission gun (FEG) SEM operated 77 at 15 keV, using backscattered electron (BSE) image mode. 78 Thin foils for transmission electron microscope (TEM) ex- 79 amination were produced from 3 mm dia., 200 mm thick discs by 80 twin-jet electropolishing at 9.5 V and $100 mA in a solution of 81 25% nitric acid in methanol at  20 oC using a Struers Tenupol 5. 82 The resulting thin foils were examined using an FEI Tecnai F20 FEG 83 TEM operated at 200 kV and equipped with energy dispersive 84 X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). 85 86 87 3. Results 88 89 3.1. Tensile tests at elevated temperatures 90 91 Tensile tests of TMT Method#1 alloys were performed at 92 700 oC. The stress strain curves of the three TMT alloys are shown 93 in Fig. 1a. All three TMT alloys show lower yield strength but 94 higher elongation compared to the as-received DAFA29, see Ta- 95 ble 2. The tensile behaviors of these TMT alloys at 700 oC are sig- 96 nificantly different from room temperature. They show yield 97 strength above 1000 MPa in room temperature tensile tests [15]. 98 Tensile tests of TMT alloys Method#2 were also carried out at 99 700 oC. The stress strain curves of the three TMT alloys are shown 100 in Fig. 1b. The results are similar to the stress strain curves ob- 101 served for the TMT Method#1 tests. All the TMT alloys show lower 102 yield strength, but higher elongation. The yield strengths (mea- 103 sured as 0.2% proof stress) were in the range of 270–346 MPa, see 104 Table 2. 105 After the tensile tests at 700 oC, all test specimens were char- 106 acterized using the SEM. All the treated samples have different 107 shapes of the necked region because of differences in ductility. 108 TMT (Method#1) alloys after ageing for 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h 109 showed reductions in area of 33%, 64%, and 93%, respectively. The 110 differences in the reduction in area are due to the different grain 111 sizes for these three treated samples [15]. The grain sizes of TMT 112 (Method#1) annealed for 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h samples are 113 $ 100 nm, $ 270 nm, and $ 1 mm, respectively [15]. Thus, the 114 elongation and reduction in area increased with increasing grain 115 size, presumably due to the reduction in yield strength. 116 For TMT alloys treated using Method#2, the reductions in area 117 for the 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h samples were 49%, 67% and 91%, re- 118 spectively. The microstructures of these TMT alloys were shown in 119 our previous work in [15]. The grain size of TMT samples with 120 ageing 2.4 h, 24 h and 240 h are $200 nm, $450 nm, and $2 mm, 121 respectively. The 240 h annealed TMT alloy also has the largest 122 area reduction and the highest elongation up to 53% due to the 123 grain growth to larger than 2 mm during 800 oC annealing [15]. 124 Fig. 2 shows fracture surfaces of as-received DAFA29, TMT 2.4 h, 125 24 h and 240 h samples after tensile testing at 700 oC. The fracture 126 surface of as-received DAFA29 shows ductile failure with large 127 ductile dimples and considerable plastic deformation between the 128 dimples. The fracture surfaces of TMT alloys are covered with a 129 thick layer of oxide due to exposure at high temperature during 130 the tensile tests. However, the Laves phase precipitates, which 131 show white contrast, are still visible. There are no dimples evident 132

21 on the fracture surface for all three TMT alloys, although the ma-
22 terials are all much more ductile than as-received DAFA29. This
23 ductility is due to the small grain sizes (ranging from $100 nm to
24 1 mm) of these three TMT samples. All three fracture surfaces are
25 coved by a layer of oxide formed during tensile test at 700 oC
26 As-received and TMT DAFA29 samples were also tested at
27 elevated temperatures from 600 oC to 800 oC. The resulting true
28 stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 3. At 600 oC (Fig. 3a), the
29 stress strain curve of as-received DAFA29 has a yield stress of
30 535 MPa, shows considerable work-hardening and an ultimate
31 tensile strength of 665 MPa at an elongation of 20%. The TMT al-
32 loys showed higher yield strengths of 928 and 886MPa for
33 Method#1 and Method#2, respectively. At 800oC, the yield
34 strength of as-received DAFA29 decreased to 360 MPa with no
35 work-hardening evident. The yield strength of TMT alloys de-
36 creased dramatically lower to 150 (Method#1) and 120MPa
37 (Method#2) with elongations more than 40%.
38 Fig. 4 provides a summary of the yield stress of as-received and
39 TMT DAFA29 tested at different temperatures. The behavior of as-
40 received DAFA29 is similar to many f.c.c. alloys reported in the
41 literature [3,16], i.e.: nickel-base superalloys and nickel iron-base
42 superalloy. The yield strength is not greatly affected by the in-
43 crease in temperature until it reaches a certain temperature. This
44 transition temperature is 600 oC for the as-received DAFA29. The
45 flow stress of L12 precipitates increase anomalously with increase
46 of temperature. Therefore, the temperature independence of the
47 yield strength of AFA alloys until 600 oC is the net effect of strength
48 reduction of f.c.c. phase compensated by the increase of strength
49 from L12 precipitates [17].
50 The TMT AFA alloys show yield stresses significantly larger than
51 the as-received DAFA29 at room temperature. This is due to the
52 fine grain size present after the TMT process for both TMT meth-
53 ods (100–200 nm). Details of the room temperature tensile test
54 results were described in previous paper [15]. As the temperature
55 increased to 600 oC, the yield stress of the TMT alloys decreased
56
86 gradually until 600 oC and then decreased dramatically at 700 oC. 87
This significant loss of stress in the range of 600–700 oC might be 88 due to increased diffusion rates in TMT alloys leading to fast dis- 89 location climb. The large volume of grain boundaries in TMT alloys 90 lose the function to interrupt of dislocation motion due to the fast 91 dislocation climbing. The grain boundaries work as sites of 92 weakness at above 600 oC. 93
At 800 oC, this grain boundary effect is more obvious. The yield 94 strength of TMT alloys is less than half of the yield strength of as- 95 received DAFA29 as shown in Fig. 4. At this temperature, disloca- 96 tions will be able to move around obstacles easily, the grain re- 97 fined TMT alloys become significantly weaker. 98
99 3.2. Strain rate jump tests at elevated temperatures 100
101 Generally, the flow stress of alloys at elevated temperature is a 102
function of the applied strain rate. The magnitude of the effect is 103 expressed by the strain rate sensitivity m. Theoretically, it is pos- 104 sible to carry out a series tensile tests at various temperatures and 105 strain rates. In practice, this is rarely done because of the limita- 106 tions of time and the numbers of specimens required. Instead, 107 strain rate jump tests can be performed using a single specimen. 108 The strain rate is increased to a second level (approximately an 109 order of magnitude) once a steady state flow stress is obtained. 110
Strain rate jump experiments were performed on as-received 111 and TMT DAFA29 at 600 oC. The strain rate jump test results are 112 shown in Fig. 5a. The initial strain rate was 5 10 5 s 1 with an 113 order of magnitude increase for each jump. The flow stresses of 114 both TMT alloys increased with the strain rate increases. But, the 115 flow stress of as-received DAFA29 is relatively independent of 116 strain rate at this temperature. It is insensitive to the strain rate 117 change at 600 oC. It is worth noting the serrations that occurred on 118 the as-received DAFA29 during testing at 600 oC. The serrated flow 119 starts when the strain rate jumps from 5 10  5 s  1 to 120 5 10 4 s 1. It is thought to be related to dynamic strain aging in 121

3.3. Strain rate influence on microstructures 104 105
In order to understand the fracture behavior of as-received 106 DAFA29 at different strain rates, tensile tests of as-received 107 DAFA29 alloys were performed at 700 oC for selected strain rates 108 (5 10 6 s 1, 5 10 4 s 1, and 5 10 2 s 1). The resulting true 109 stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 6. The flow stresses are 110 comparable to the results from the strain rate jump test results 111
￼35 this material. We will further explain these serrations in the dis-
￼36 cussion section.
37 Strain rate jump tests were also performed at 700 oC which is
￼38 the target application temperature for AFA stainless steels. The
39 results of strain rate jump tests of as-received and TMT DAFA29
￼40 performed are shown in Fig. 5b. The initial strain rate was
41 5 10 5 s 1 with an order of magnitude increase for each jump.
￼42 The flow stresses of all samples increased with the strain rate in-
43 creasing. At the strain rate of 5 10 5 s 1, the flow stress of as-
￼44 received DAFA29 was 445 MPa which is almost twice that of TMT
45 DAFA29 of 292MPa. When the strain rate is jumped to 46

4. Discussion 106 107
At 700 oC, the yield strength of as-received DAFA29 is 523MPa 108 and it is slightly lower than its room temperature yield strength 109 560 MPa [15]. It work-hardens significantly with an elongation of 110 20% at room temperature, while it shows low work-hardening rate 111 at 700 oC with an elongation of 28%. 112

￼32 in Fig. 7a effectively enhanced the dislocation interactions which
33 created additional barriers in the lattice for slip. These barriers
￼34 produced the high work hardening rate observed at this strain rate
35 (Fig. 6). For the lower strain rates, the dislocation density was also
￼￼38 no work hardening and lower dislocation densities. The disloca-
39 tions in Fig. 7a are observed to align along one direction. This
40 might due to the high strain rate during the tensile test.
41 In Fig. 7c, Fe2Nb Laves phase and NiAl precipitates are present.
42 These precipitates are located on grain boundaries and they are
43 generated during the low strain rate test. Small ( $ 26 nm) sphe-
44 rical L12–Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates are also uniformly distributed in
45 the f.c.c. matrix. The dislocations show strong interactions with
46 these L12 precipitates. Numerous dislocation loops around L12

47 higher elongation compared to the as-received DAFA29, see
48 Figs. 1 and 4. It is evident that the TMTs which result in a fine grain
49 size significantly improve the room temperature properties, but
50 this grain size strengthening is negligible at 700oC. In room
51 temperature, assuming off-set stress s0 is constant for all TMT
52 alloys, the estimate grain size strengthening effect is $600 MPa
53 according to the △s 1⁄4 KD  1/2 [15,18].
54 As the temperature increased to 700 oC, the strengthening ef-
55 fect becomes negligible due to the weakness of grain boundaries.
56 For the 2.4 h annealed samples, the TMT Method #1 alloy still
57 showed higher strength than TMT Method #2 alloy at 700 oC al-
58 though it has more grain boundaries (smaller grain size). This is
59 mainly because the high temperature strength of TMT alloys has a
60 strengthening contribution from the small Laves phase pre-
61 cipitates as well as the grain boundaries. The Laves phase pre-
62 cipitates in TMT Method #1 alloys are in the range of 167737 nm
63 which is slightly smaller than it is in TMT Method #2 alloys
64 (175 7 45 nm) [15].
65 For all the annealed specimens, the 2.4 h and 24 h annealed
66 TMT Method#1 alloys shows higher yield strength compared to
111 TMT Method#2 alloys due to a smaller grain size. When the an- 112 nealing time was increased to 240 h, TMT Method#2 alloys have 113 higher strength than TMT Method#2. This might be due to an 114 increase in the volume fraction of the Laves phase during the long 115 time aging process. After 240 h aging, the large Laves phase pre- 116 cipitates in TMT Method#2 alloys are not present. Instead smaller 117 Laves phase are precipitated out with size of $560 nm [15]. In 118 TMT Method#1 alloys, there are still large Laves phase precipitate 119 present in the microstructure. 120 The following section will discuss the strain rate sensitivity of 121 the as-received and TMT DAFA29. The deformation mechanism at 122 elevated temperature will also be discussed based on the flow 123 stress and strain rate for each alloy. Table 4 summarizes the flow 124 stress at different strain rates for the as-received and TMT DAFA29 125 alloys. 126

and activation volumes can be obtained based on the value of the
slope. The activation volume for metals is normally expressed in 88 terms of b3, where b is the shortest burgers vector of a perfect 89 dislocation. In f.c.c. iron the Burgers vector is 0.253 nm [24]. The 90 calculated activation volumes for DAFA29 at 700 oC is 1.1 b3, while 91 the values for the TMT alloys are 0.7 b3 (Method#1) and 0.8 b3 92 (Method#2) respectively. The activation volume for the fine 93 grained TMT alloys is smaller than that of the coarse-grained al- 94 loys. Dislocations have a higher activation barrier when the grain 95 size enters the nanometer regime. This is similar to other alloys 96 tested at both room temperature and elevated temperature [24– 97 26]. 98

where G is shear modulus, b is Burgers vector, D is diffusion 108 coefficient of the f.c.c. matrix, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is 109 absolute temperature, and n is the stress exponent. A stress ex- 110 ponent n in the range of 3–5 is typical for solid solution alloys. 111 Specifically, n is 5 for nickel and nickel–chromium alloys [27–29]. 112 For precipitate-strengthened alloys, the n values obtained are 113 normally larger than the solid solution alloys [30].

24 is the strain rate sensitivity parameter.
25 Based on the flow stress results shown in Table 4, the flow
26 stress is plotted as a function of strain rate on a log–log scale in
27 Fig. 8. The strain rate sensitivity m can be obtained from
of the precipitates. The effective stress is defined as s–st. Thus, Eq. 119

(5) 123 124 The value of the threshold stress st depends on the dislocation 125
precipitate interaction mechanism. The mechanism could be dis- 126 location cutting, Orowan looping, or dislocation climb. This value 127 can be determined using the methodology suggested by Lagne- 128 borg and Bergman [33]. Basically, Eq. (5) can be rewritten: 129

￼￼30
31 The m value can be obtained based on a linear fit as shown in
32 Fig. 8. m of as-received DAFA29 is 0.12, while the values for TMT
33 DAFA29 is 0.18 (Method#1) and 0.19 (Method#2), i.e. the yield
34 stresses of the TMT DAFA29 alloys are more sensitive to strain rate
35 compared to the as-received DAFA29 at 700 oC. The slight differ-
36 ence in m values for TMT Method#1 and Method#2 is probably
37 due to different grain sizes [15]. At 600oC m for as-received
38 DAFA29 is 0.02, whereas the m values for the TMT AFA alloys are
39 0.08 (Method#1) and 0.09 (Method#2). All the m values obtained
at 600 oC are much smaller than those obtained at 700 oC, in-
41 dicating that the strain rate sensitivity is influenced by the tem-
42 perature for all tested alloys.
43 At both 600 oC and 700 oC, the alloys treated by Method#2 with
44 a grain size of $200nm have a slightly higher m than alloys
45 treated by Method#1. Alloys treated by Method#1 have a grain
46 size of $100nm which is about half size of alloys treated by
47 Method#2. It shows an increase in strain rate sensitivity with
48 decreasing grain size. This trend has also been observed in other
49 nanocrystalline alloys [19,20].
50 At the same testing temperature, the strain rate sensitivity is
51 larger for the smaller nano-sized grains in the TMT alloys com-
52 pared to coarse grains of $ 40 mm for the as-received DAFA29. A
53 number of models [19,21,22] indicate a grain size dependence of
54 the strain rate sensitivity is related to a decrease in the activation
55 volume V.
56 The strain rate sensitivity m can also be expressed as

27 217 MPa for as-received DAFA29 at 700 oC, which is similar to the
28 threshold stress value measured in another AFA alloy tested at the
29 same temperature [7]. The threshold stresses are 50 MPa (Meth-
30 od#1) and 9 MPa (Method#2) for the TMT alloys tested at 700 oC.

￼￼￼￼￼33 summary of threshold stresses for the different processing con-
where τo is the shear stress necessary for precipitates bypass by 91 Orowan bowing, L is particle spacing, r is the radius of precipitates. 92 At 700 oC, the average size of Ni3(Al, Ti) precipitates is 35 nm 93 after an 800 oC anneal for 2.4 h. The particle spacing obtained 94 based on L and the volume fraction is 140 nm [15]. The volume 95 fraction of L12 phase can be calculated based on density and phase 96 fraction from a JMatPro simulation shown in Fig. 11. G is ap- 97 proximately 50GPa for AFA alloys and b is estimate to be 98 0.253 nm. The calculated Orowan shear stress is about 180 MPa for 99 both TMT AFA alloys. The threshold stress values of TMT alloys are 100 about 0.3τo (50 MPa for Method#1) and 0.05τo (9 MPa for Meth- 101 od#2). These values are similar to those obtained from the Arzt– 102 Ashby model for the local climb and general climb mechanisms 103 [35]. For as-received DAFA29, the calculated Orowan shear stress is 104 about 212 MPa with a particle spacing of 120 nm and average 105 particle size of 30 nm. This Orowan stress is consistent with the 106 threshold stresses of as-received DAFA29, which is 217 MPa. 107 At 600 oC, the threshold stress values are much higher than 108 Orowan shear stress for both TMT alloys. This might be due to a 109

35 slightly larger than Method#2 for both temperatures. The value of
￼36 the threshold stress decreased significantly with an increase in 37
￼38 temperature, is almost zero for alloys treated by Method#2 at
39 higher temperature.
40 Fig. 10 shows plot of strain rate as a function of effective stress
41 (s - st) for the as-received and TMT DAFA29 alloys. The corrected
42 n value is 4.2 for the as-received DAFA29 tested at 700 oC which is
43 close to the stress exponent value of another AFA alloy reported in
44 [7]. At 600 oC, the n values of treated alloys decrease to 4.9 and
45 5.0 which are typical of n values for solid solution alloys [34].
46 The extrapolated threshold stresses of the treated alloys at
￼￼￼￼47 600 oC are much higher than those obtained at 700 oC. They de-
48 crease significantly with the increase in temperature of 100 oC.

4 4.3. Dynamic strain aging of DAFA29
5
6 At 600 oC, the yield stress of as-received DAFA29 is insensitive
7 to the strain rate, as shown in Fig. 5a. The flow stress curve shows
8 evidence of negative strain rate sensitivity with significant ser-
9 rated flow. This serrated flow starts when the strain rate jumps
10 from 5 10  5 to 5 10  4 s  1. This phenomenon is also observed
11 for other stainless steels and high temperature superalloys [36–
12 40]. The serrated flow is expected to be associated with dynamic
13 strain aging (DSA) which occurs at certain combinations of tem-
14 perature and strain rate [36,40]. The occurrence of DSA is the re-
15 sult of solute diffusion in the metal lattice during plastic de-
16 formation at certain temperatures. The accumulation of these so-
17 lute elements can impede the movement of dislocations and re-
18 sults in serrated flow curves. The solute elements typically re-
19 sponsible for this behavior are carbon below 550 oC, and Cr or Mo
20 at temperatures above 550 oC [40,41].
21
22 4.4. DAFA29 is insensitive to strain rate at 600 oC 23
24 The yield stress of DAFA29 is not dependent on the strain rate
25 at 600 oC. This might be related to the work hardening of DAFA29
26 at this temperature. At 700oC or higher, there is little work
27 hardening for DAFA29 as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The reduction of
28 work hardening in as-received DAFA29 at temperature of 700 oC
29 and higher temperature is due to a softening mechanism such as
30 dynamic recovery which is expected to become the dominant
31 mechanism at elevated temperature [38]. At higher temperatures,
32 the work hardening due to the increase in dislocation density with
33 increasing strain is counteracted by the formation of subgrains
34 with low energy dislocations. Thermally-activated climb of dis-
35 locations is the prominent dynamic recovery mechanism for pre-
36 cipitate-strengthened alloys. This will overcome the obstacles of
37 dislocation motion which is restrained at the lower temperature of
38 600 oC. This is also influenced by strain rate during tensile tests
39 since the recovery is diffusion controlled process [38].

42 5. Conclusions 43
44 In this paper, the recently-developed AFA alloy, DAFA29, was
45 treated by two TMT methods. The resulting fine-grained alloys
46 were tensile tested at elevated temperature. Their mechanical
47 properties were also evaluated by strain rate jump tests at two
48 different temperatures. These results were compared to data for
49 the as-received AFA alloy. The findings of this research are sum-
50 marized as follows:

deformation of TMT alloys. When the temperature decrease to 600 oC, the mechanism changes to dislocation shearing as in- dicated by the dramatically increased threshold stress.
5. The yield stress of TMT alloys decrease rapidly from 600 oC to 700 oC, which might be because increased diffusion rates in TMT alloys lead to fast dislocation climb at 700 oC. At this tempera- ture, dislocation will be able to move around obstacles easily and the large volume of grain boundaries in TMT alloys work as sites of weakness.
6. The flow stress of the as-received AFA alloy is insensitive to strain rate at 600oC due to strong work hardening at this temperature. It also shows significant serrated flow on the stress strain curve, which is associated with dynamic strain aging effect.

For the two TMT AFA alloys, the strain rate and stress satisfy a power law relationship with the stress exponent around 5, whereas the stress exponent is around 4 for the as-received DAFA29. These values ruled out the mechanisms of bulk diffu- sion (Nabarro-Herring mechanism) and grain boundary diffu- sion (Coble mechanism) to explain the flow behavior.
At 700 oC, dislocation climb is the dominant mechanism for

The TMT AFA alloys have higher strain rate sensitivity and lower activation volume compared to as-received DAFA29 at elevated temperatures. The higher strain rate sensitivity and lower acti- vation volume are due to the nanocrystalline grain size of the alloys.

1.1	Background
	Increasing efficiency while decreasing the cost of operating advanced power plants has been an ongoing process. Energy efficiency gains in fossil energy conversion and combustion system applications also result in the added benefit of reducing CO2 emissions, bolstering the motivation to pursue efficiency-increasing strategies { | Viswanathan, et al., 2004 | | |zu:2902168:SB3FI4HD}{ | Viswanathan, et al., 2006 | | |zu:2902168:5T7X6XNB}{ | Viswanathan, et al., 2008 | | |zu:2902168:VCJX2678}{ | Viswanathan, et al., 2005 | | |zu:2902168:M9KI53RT}. The efficiency of energy conversion applications is a strong function of steam temperature and pressure, thus increases in energy efficiency can be realized by elevating operating steam temperatures and pressures { | Viswanathan, &amp; Bakker, 2001 | | |zu:2902168:7689KUZX}. An increase in operating temperatures from 600°C to 800°C results in an efficiency increase of more than 10%. Efforts are currently underway to enable advanced power plants to function at temperatures greater than 700°C. An important contributor to realizing these higher steam temperatures and pressures is the material composition of the power plants' industrial gas turbine components, super heater tubes and boilers { | Yamamoto, et al., 2007 | | |zu:2902168:85ZQGZD8}. Currently, many energy production and chemical processing plants operate at temperatures below 600°C due to the poor performance of martensitic and ferritic steel alloys at higher temperatures { | Viswanathan, &amp; Bakker, 2000 | | |zu:2902168:PE3VWWHP}. To withstand the high temperature and pressure demands of energy applications, metal alloys must have the necessary material properties to withstand such conditions. These properties include the materials' high-temperature long term creep strength, oxidation and corrosion resistance and strength. Aggressive environments, where metal components are exposed to water vapor, sulfur and carbon species, are a prime target for new materials being developed { | Yamamoto, et al., 2007 | | |zu:2902168:4MNWSE4J}. 
		Nickel-based superalloys and austenitic alloys with high nickel concentrations perform well and have the necessary creep strength and oxidation and corrosion resistance to withstand such conditions, but are prohibitively expensive and not economically viable except for use in specialized applications due to the high levels of nickel and nickel’s cost { | Viswanathan, et al., 2008 | | |zu:2902168:VCJX2678}{ | Viswanathan, et al., 2005 | | |zu:2902168:M9KI53RT}. Thus, other alloys are now being researched and developed that can withstand the demands of such energy conversion and combustion systems as well as to decrease reliance on costly nickel-based alloys. However, in order for an alternative to be viable, it must have the strength, long-term creep resistance and oxidation resistance close to or exceeding that of nickel-based alloys. One promising class of alloys that are low in cost and potentially capable of withstanding the rigors placed on the materials by high temperature energy applications are alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels (AFAs) { | Yamamoto, et al., 2007 | | |zu:2902168:85ZQGZD8}{ | Brady, et al., 2007 | | |zu:2902168:CQH9PX4J}{ | Brady, et al., 2008 | | |zu:2902168:VU6Q4EDM}{ | Pint, et al., 2007 | | |zu:2902168:9NXG7NJ2}{ | Brady, et al., 2009 | | |zu:2902168:SZSS7FI6}{ | Yamamoto, et al., 2009 | | |zu:2902168:UK5QSMTK}{ | Brady, et al., 2014 | | |zu:2902168:PD5B4ZPG}{ | Yamamoto, et al., 2013 | | |zu:2902168:37HVMBC9}. However, more investigation is needed into the oxidation and corrosion resistance as well as the creep strength in order for this class of steels to be widely used as an alternative to nickel-based alloys. 
	1.2	Alumina-Forming Austenitic Stainless Steels	
	Extensive efforts are underway to improve the high-temperature strength, corrosion and oxidation resistance, and long-term creep resistance of AFAs, ideally at lower cost compared with currently used materials. Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory have developed a new family of AFAs in the last few years that have yielded promising results for use with elevated temperatures above 700°C in aggressive environments { | Brady, et al., 2014 | | |zu:2902168:USZ8XMC2}{ | Yamamoto, et al., 2007 | | |zu:2902168:UQXIIP8N}{ | Brady, et al., 2008 | | |zu:2902168:PB5FB5Z3}{ | Yamamoto, et al., 2008 | | |zu:2902168:X76SQJXR}{ | Yamamoto, et al., 2011 | | |zu:2902168:UJ9EJWHK}. These new AFAs being developed have a composition range of Fe-(12-35)Ni-(12-15)Cr-(2.5-4)Al-(0.6–3)Nb (wt %), and include alloying additions such as Al, Cr, Mn and Ni to maintain a single phase austenitic matrix microstructure { | Brady, et al., 2014 | | |zu:2902168:USZ8XMC2}. 
		The alumina (Al2O3) layer that forms in AFAs at temperatures between 600-900°C, acts as a protective barrier and increases the oxidation and corrosion resistance of the material. Austenitic steels without sufficient additions of aluminum use chromia (Cr2O3) scales as a protective layer, but in environments with high concentrations of water vapor and other oxidizing agents, the chromia scales perform poorly. Relatively small amounts of aluminum additions to austenitic steels have the ability to form the protective alumina surface layer. It’s been shown that these alumina scale formations remain stable at operating temperatures from 650-800°C, with the necessary oxidation resistance in environments with water vapor present, making AFAs the preferred choice for use in low-cost, high-temperature structural materials { | Kofstad, &amp; Bredesen, 1992 | | |zu:2902168:JCTUIGD6}{ | Pint, et al., 2006 | | |zu:2902168:U89A5P53}{ | Pint, et al., 2004 | | |zu:2902168:9KQPSD4R}{ | Yamamoto, et al., 2007 | | |zu:2902168:85ZQGZD8}{ | Brady, et al., 2010 | | |zu:2902168:H6UIDG3Q}{ | Yamamoto, et al., 2006 | | |zu:2902168:9BTPENSB}{ | Brady, et al., 2007 | | |zu:2902168:CQH9PX4J}. Ferritic FeCrAl alloys have excellent oxidation and corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures, however at temperatures greater than 600°C their creep resistance does not meet expectations set by nickel-based alloys, a property that is attributed to their open body-centered-cubic (b.c.c) structure { | Brady, et al., 2014 | | |zu:2902168:USZ8XMC2}.  
		Precipitates play a large role in determining the mechanical properties of an alloy. Both the type of precipitate and their distribution have an effect on an alloy’s strength and creep resistance. Precipitate nucleation occurs due to the strain energy being lowered { | Cahn, 1957 | | |zu:2902168:R27TI7KH}. Precipitates nucleate preferentially on grain boundaries due to a larger strain energy reduction compared with precipitation occurring on dislocations, which has a higher activation energy { | Porter, et al., 2009 | | |zu:2902168:2MM6WBDJ}. The type, size, distribution and volume fraction all have an effect on the alloy’s properties. The effect of various precipitates and their phases on creep strength in AFAs with a variety of alloying elements is still being explored to identify the optimum combination of alloys and precipitates for their use at elevated temperatures in the 600°C to 800°C range. Small changes in alloy composition and precipitate phases often result in a wide variation of creep strengths { | Viswanathan, &amp; Bakker, 2001 | | |zu:2902168:7689KUZX}{ | Yamamoto, et al., 2013 | | |zu:2902168:37HVMBC9}{ | Chen, et al., 2014 | | |zu:2902168:GDI3FBC2}. 
	1.3	AFA precipitates
	In the past, AFAs have primarily used MC carbides (with the metal primarily being niobium) or γ’-Ni3Al for their strength { | Brady, et al., 2008 | | |zu:2902168:4UVJT7ZI}{ | Yamamoto, et al., 2007 | | |zu:2902168:UQXIIP8N}. Particles that are ~10 nm in size are effective at increasing creep strength by pinning dislocations in the f.c.c. austenitic matrix. However at elevated temperatures above 800°C, the carbide precipitates coarsen and dissolve { | Pint, et al., 2009 | | |zu:2902168:CVM8HWFW}, making them unsuitable for strengthening purposes in elevated temperature applications. Newer grades of AFAs being developed have an austenitic face-centered-cubic matrix instead of a b.c.c matrix, and their elevated temperature creep resistance and strength is achieved through not only the existing MC carbides and γ’-Ni3Al precipitates, but also Fe2Nb Laves phase and NiAl-type B2 precipitates { | Sourmail, 2001 | | |zu:2902168:UJ3U2B4C}{ | Abe, et al., 2007 | | |zu:2902168:M5BVQK2E}{ | Brady, et al., 2014 | | |zu:2902168:USZ8XMC2}{ | Stott, et al., 1995 | | |zu:2902168:HEWBBS3B}{ | Yamamoto, et al., 2007 | | |zu:2902168:85ZQGZD8}. 
		Intermetallic precipitates have the potential to be used as strengtheners in AFA alloys to further improve their creep resistance. The formation of Fe2Nb Laves phase precipitates along grain boundaries in ferritic steels results in a decrease in the alloys’ toughness and yield strength { | Kato, et al., 2010 | | |zu:2902168:V73NJ84H}. In contrast, creep strengthening has been achieved in AFAs { | Liu, et al., 2000 | | |zu:2902168:7QWGA24G}{ | Yamamoto, et al., 2007 | | |zu:2902168:UQXIIP8N}. For example the AFA alloy Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at%) demonstrates good ductility and strength, even with extensive intermetallic formation of C14 Laves phase precipitates along the grain boundaries { | Trotter, &amp; Baker, 2015 | | |zu:2902168:25396B3B}. It has been shown that in Fe-20Cr-(25–35)Ni-2Nb (at.%) alloys, fine dispersions of strengthening Fe2Nb Laves phase can form within the austenitic iron matrix { | Cao, &amp; Kennedy, 2001 | | |zu:2902168:CW3SMDBS}. The use of Fe2Nb Laves phase particles has shown thermal stability up to its melting point of 1640°C in the Fe-Nb system over a prolonged duration { | Massalski, et al., 1904 | | |zu:2902168:25HIHA5G} and exists in equilibrium with f.c.c. γ-Fe above 955°C in the Fe-Cr-Ni base steel { | Villars, et al., 1995 | | |zu:2902168:Z63677GQ}, making it a good candidate for strengthening AFAs at elevated temperatures. 
#
Figure 1.1: Diagram of the C14 Fe2Nb Laves phase structure. 
		Prior work with the intermetallic Laves phase Fe2Nb has shown that the strengthening effect of the precipitate is dependent on whether it precipitates on grain boundaries or in the austenitic matrix, and in what volume fractions and particle size it appears in the alloy { | Yamamoto, et al., 2008 | | |zu:2902168:P4GIA9HS}. See figure 1.1 for a diagram depicting the hexagonal C14 Fe2Nb Laves phase structure. As the Laves phase particles increase in density and size, the brittle properties of the precipitate cause the material to lose its strength and creep resistance. Thus, a fine particle dispersion diameter of &lt;100 nm is recommended to match the creep strength exhibited by AFAs strengthened with MC carbides and prevent failure of the material { | Yamamoto, et al., 2008 | | |zu:2902168:P4GIA9HS}. This decrease in the precipitate size and increase of the precipitate volume fraction in the austenitic matrix, allows for dislocations to be pinned leading to an increase in the alloy’s creep strength. It has recently been shown by Tagigan et al. that in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at.%), the alloy’s long-term creep resistance increased with an increasing area fraction of Laves phase precipitated on the grain boundary. It was also noted that dislocations that piled up near Laves phase grain boundaries were effective at suppressing local deformation by inhibiting the motion of dislocations and thereby increasing the long-term creep strength of the alloy { | Tarigan, et al., 2011 | | |zu:2902168:G78CMASC}{ | Tarigan, et al., 2012 | | |zu:2902168:RB6XSGVQ}. This creep-strengthening mechanism was coined “grain boundary precipitation strengthening mechanism” by Tarigan et al.
		Yamamoto et al found that in addition to Fe2Nb Laves phase forming, after heat treating at 750°C, dense and fine B2-type NiAl (AB) precipitates formed in the γ-Fe matrix and on the grain boundaries { | Yamamoto, et al., 2011 | | |zu:2902168:UJ9EJWHK}. The B2-type NiAl phase particles were dark in contrast and between 300 nm to 1 μm in size. The Fe2Nb-type Laves phase particles appeared spherical with a bright contrast in the matrix and less than 500 nm in size. See Figure 1.2 for an example of precipitate contrast in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %). At elevated temperatures, B2-type NiAl precipitates play an important role in providing corrosion and oxidation resistance by acting as an aluminum reservoir for formation of the alumina protective layer { | Brady, et al., 2008 | | |zu:2902168:HBC2NU6I}. They are not effective in improving the high-temperature tensile strength at temperatures greater than 400°C { | Satyanarayana, et al., 2001 | | |zu:2902168:I7ZM2B32}{ | Satyanarayana, et al., 2002 | | |zu:2902168:CX4DKZC5}, however it’s been posited that B2-type NiAl precipitates improve creep resistance by affecting the climb of dislocations in the matrix or the precipitate’s resistance to dislocation slicing { | Yamamoto, et al., 2011 | | |zu:2902168:UJ9EJWHK}.

		In order to better predict which precipitates are most beneficial for increasing AFA high temperature creep strength, further tests and characterization needs to be performed to form a better understanding of the complex interactions between the presence of various precipitates and phases and their effect on the alloys’ creep properties.

            <Text>￼INTRODUCTION
Even with the surge in use of renewable energy, for the foreseeable future the primary energy source for power applications is likely to be fossil fuels. Using these resources as efficiently as possible for both economic reasons and to minimize carbon dioxide emissions is critical (Viswanathan and Bakker, 2000; Viswanathan et al., 2005). In order for power plants to be more efficient they need to run at higher temperature: an operating temperature increase from 873 K to 1073 K would increase the efficiency from &lt;40% to &gt;50%. This requires materials that are strong enough, can withstand an environment that may contain not only steam but also sulfur, display good oxidation and corrosion resistance and are economically viable (Viswanathan et al., 2005). The ultimate goal is to have a material that has a creep rupture stress of 70 MPa for 105 h operating at a temperature of 1073 K (Takeyama, 2007), and eventually at 1143 K (Project 463, 2007).
The martensitic/ferritic alloys that are currently used in power plants are limited to use at operating temperatures ≤873 K (Viswanathan and Bakker, 2000). Nickel-based superalloys, some titanium alloys, and, possibly, oxide-dispersion strengthened ferritic alloys (Miller et al., 2003, 2005) can satisfy the strength and, at least for nickel-based alloys (Project 463, 2007), the oxidation and corrosion requirements at temperatures ≤933 K. Unfortunately, these materials are too expensive except for use in specialized applications (Takeyama, 2007). This critical need for advanced materials for steam turbine components in ultra supercritical power plants has been long recognized and forms the basis of efforts in Japan, Europe and the U.S. (Viswanathan and Bakker 2000; Takeyama, 2007).
Recent efforts in this area have focused on devising new austenitic steels strengthened with Laves phases, see Figure 1 (Maziasz, 1989; Takeyama et al., 2001; Takeyama, 2007; Yamamoto et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2008), whose purpose is to provide a “grain boundary precipitation strengthening mechanism” (Tarigan et al., 2011, 2012). The addition of aluminum can be used to improve oxidation resistance in these alloys (Yamamoto et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b; Brady et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b). Such alumina- forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels have shown promise to decrease our reliance on expensive Nickel-base alloys for aggressive conditions in energy production and chemical processing environments (Brady et al., 2014). AFAs use alumina instead of chromia as a
￼protective oxide scale for high corrosion resistance since it is known to offer even better protection at high temperatures (Kofstas, 1995; Heubner 2000). AFA stainless steels were in development as early as the 1970s (McGurty, 1978) and more recently a new family of AFAs has been under development at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL (Yamamoto et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b, 2008, 2011; Brady et al., 2005, 2007a, 2008; 2014). In the newer grades of AFAs, both B2-structured NiAl and Laves phase precipitates are present on both the grain boundaries and in the austenitic matrix, and MC precipitates or L12-structured Ni3Al precipitates are used to increase the creep strength (Brady et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2008; 2011). While great strides have been made in these AFA stainless steels optimization of their properties has been difficult because the effects that different alloying elements and precipitates have on their creep strength is not understood. The AFA stainless steels studied encompass a wide range of compositions and continued study of this system is needed to find the optimal combination of alloying elements that provide the best creep strength and oxidation resistance with a balance of cost for future commercialization (Brady et al., 2014).

The purpose of this proposal and the intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to understand the high temperature deformation behavior of AFA stainless steels and elucidate the role of the different precipitates and solute additions on the creep strength. The work will focus on the model alloy Fe- 20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al. This was chosen because it can be fully solutionized upon annealing at 1523 K and because we have experience with it in our current project. While working on a specific alloy, the precipitation phenomena and deformation behavior that will be studied have applicability to many alloy

￼systems. It is worth noting that the proposed work is not an alloy development effort, but is focused on fundamental work that will aid further development (by others) of precipitate-strengthened austenitic alloys. The work will involve several collaborations: with Prof. Min Song, Central South University, Changsha, PRC on creep testing; with Prof. Simon P. Ringer, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia on Atom probe tomography (APT); and with Prof. Paul R. Munroe, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Australia on using an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA).
FURTHER BACKGROUND
Laves-Phase Strengthened Austenitic Stainless Steels
Takeyama et al. (2001) systematically studied Laves phase precipitation in the austenitic Fe-20Cr-(25- 40)Ni-2Nb (in at. %) quaternary alloy system. The precipitates, which adopt the hexagonal C14 structure, are often referred to as the ε phase. For alloys containing 35 at. % Ni, the precipitates are elongated with many interfacial dislocations, whereas for alloys containing 25 at. % Ni the precipitates are smaller and more equi-axed. In these Fe-Cr-Ni-Nb alloys, the c/a ratio of the precipitates decreases as the Ni content decreases for 15-25 at. % Ni and changes little with further increases in Ni content. At 25 at. % Ni the c/a ratio is about the same as that of binary stoichiometric Fe2Nb at 1.63, which is near the value for the cubic symmetry C15 Laves structure. Although the precipitates are referred to by Takeyama (2007) as Fe2Nb, they contain 14-15 at. % Cr, 26 at. % Nb and 17-25% Ni, depending on the overall alloy composition. Takeyama (2007) determined TTT curves for the precipitates and found that precipitation at 1173-1273 K occurred first on the grain boundaries after ~300 s, but only after &gt;1000 s in the matrix. After long ageing times (4.32 x 106 s) the precipitates on the grain boundaries became significantly larger (≤ 3 μm).
In contrast, Yamamoto et al. (2007b) found that the ε Laves phase precipitates in the matrix of the alloy Fe-15Cr-20Ni-(1-2)Nb were relatively stable during both ageing and creep testing at 1073 K. This stability may arise partly from the semi-coherent interface of the Fe2Nb precipitates, as indicated by the strain contrast present in transmission electron microscope (TEM) images even after long-term annealing (Takeyama, 2007), and also from the presence of small additions of Al, Mo, C and B. Small elemental additions have also been shown to stabilize Laves phases in other systems: Maziasz (1989) noted that Si additions led to the formation of Fe2(Mo,Nb) precipitates in austenitic alloys, while Yamamoto et al. (2008) found that small Zr additions promote Fe2Ti Laves phase precipitates.
Yamamoto et al. (2008) studied the microstructural evolution of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb alloys with and without additions of 0.4 Si, 0.2 Zr or 5.0 Al (in at. %) during creep at 1023 K and 100 MPa. The Si addition helped to both refine the particle size (from ~1 μm to 300 nm) and produce a greater volume fraction of particles during ageing at 1073 K, and stabilized them against coarsening, resulting in superior creep resistance. Interestingly, alloys that were only solution treated showed superior creep properties to those that were aged prior to creep testing. The authors speculated that this phenomenon on was because the particles that were dynamically precipitated during creep were finer (300-400 nm) and, thus, more effective at pinning dislocations. The Zr addition improved the creep resistance more dramatically than the Si additions possibly by stabilizing very fine δ-Ni3Nb particles. The addition of Al not only improved the creep resistance due to the formation of 30 nm diameter Ni3Al precipitates, but also improved the oxidation through the formation of a protective alumina layer on the surface.
The fundamental issues with the use of austenitic alloys for high temperature applications were articulated by Yamamoto et al. (2008) who noted that “The strengthening effect of Fe2Nb (Laves phase) strongly depends on its size and volume fraction, indicating that the thermal stability of the particle size and distributions is the key to improve creep properties.” More specifically, the two key issues are that: 1) the increase in size and density of the large Laves phase particles that develop on the grain boundaries during creep testing (Yamamoto et al. 2008) will ultimately result in specimen failure when the grain boundary coverage of these brittle particles is large enough; and 2) further refinement of the Laves phase precipitates to ~100 nm dia. is necessary to improve the creep strength Yamamoto et al. (2008).
Recently, Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) examined the effect of boron (0.03%) on the creep strength of Fe- 20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (in at. %). Both the boron-doped and boron-free alloys with contained Ni3Nb precipitates (the γ” phase at short annealing times and the δ phase at long times) within the grains and Laves phase
￼precipitates on the grain boundaries. The boron decreased the creep rate and increased the creep rupture life by a factor of almost four. The role of boron appeared to be to increase the extent of the Laves phase precipitation at the grain boundaries. Simply aging the boron-free alloy to increase the extent of grain boundary coverage by the Laves phase from 52% to 89% also increased the creep rupture life and decreased the creep rate to a similar extent as the boron addition. That even with 89% grain boundary coverage by the Laves phase precipitates a creep rupture strain of 77% was attained shows that the precipitates don’t necessarily embrittle the alloy. Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) found that the creep
rate, ε, was related to the area fraction covered by the grain boundary Laves phase, ρ, according to: ε/ε0 = (1- ρ) - (1)
ε0 is the creep rate when ρ = 0. They suggested that the role of the grain boundary phase was to suppress deformation at the grain boundaries.
Chen et al. (2014) also studied Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb with and without 0.03% B and found that boron both increased the extent and produced finer Laves phase precipitates on the grain boundaries, but by &lt;10% after their longest anneal of 24h, when the grain boundary coverage in the B-doped alloy was ~80%. Using an EPMA, they showed strong boron segregation to the grain boundaries. They found that for both the boron-doped and boron-free alloy, longer aging times prior to creep testing increased the creep life (by up to 100% for a 4h versus a 12 h anneal), and that for the same aging time boron doping increased the creep life (by up to 44% for short aging times but by less at long aging times) by producing greater grain boundary coverage of the Laves phase. Chen et al.’s (2014) results were very similar to those of Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012). Essentially, boron appears to reduce the annealing time to obtain a large grain boundary coverage by the Laves phase.
Alumina-Forming Austenitic Stainless Steels
Even within particular grades of AFAs, the influence of particular precipitate phases on creep strength is complex. A wide variety of creep strengths can be obtained with relatively small changes in alloying elements and phases that are beneficial in some AFAs appear to cause decreased creep strength in others. There are generally three grades of AFAs that have been investigated by the ORNL group based on their nickel content, viz., 20-25Ni, 12Ni, and 32Ni. The 12Ni grade alloys substitute Mn for some of the Ni both to stabilize the austenite relative to the deleterious δ–Fe phase formation and to lower the cost. Unfortunately, this grade has been shown to have relatively poor creep resistance although the reason for the decreased creep strength is poorly understood (Brady et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2011). In 20-25 Ni grade alloys it has been found that the total weight fraction of carbide phases is important. For example, in a 20-25Ni grade alloy with 2.53 wt. % Nb and 0.201 wt. % C there was little MC supersaturation and it showed poor creep resistance compared to 25Ni grade alloys with 1 wt.% Nb and 0.1 wt. % C. It is believed that the 2.53 wt.% Nb alloy showed poorer creep strength because the 2.53 wt.% Nb addition decreased the supersaturation of MC carbides (Brady et al., 2014). The 1 wt. % Nb and 0.1 wt. % C additions have been shown to be the optimal amounts for MC carbide strengthening in other studies of AFAs as well (Brady et al, 2008; Yamamoto et al., 2009). While increasing the Nb content from 1 wt. % to 2.5 wt. % seemed to have a detrimental role on the creep strength for a 25Ni alloy, in the 32Ni grade alloys with 3.3 Nb wt. %, superior creep strength has been observed at 650oC, a feature that appears to be due to strengthening from L12 Ni3Al precipitates, producing a creep strength almost five times greater than the best carbide strengthened 20-25 Ni alloy. While the L12 Ni3Al improved the creep properties of the 32Ni alloy, at 650°C it is believed that the metastable L12 Ni3Al caused the decreased rupture time observed in a 25Ni-4Al-1Nb alloy with increased C content compared to a 25Ni- 3Al-1Nb alloy. Although the creep strength was promising there was a tradeoff with significantly reduced creep elongation in the 32Ni grade alloy, which is thought to be due to σ-phase formation. At 750oC, the 32Ni alloy creep results were comparable to those of both the 20-25Ni and 12Ni alloy grades (Brady et al., 2014).
32Ni grade alloys with decreased chromium content (14 wt. % versus 19 wt. %) and additional alloying elements such as Zr and Ti have less σ-phase formation and improved creep properties. Indeed, a Zr, Ti alloyed 32Ni alloy with additions of carbon and boron was shown to have a creep-rupture life that exceeded that of the commercially-available Fe-base alloy A286 by an order of magnitude (Yamamoto, Muralidharan, Brady, 2013). Boron improves the creep properties of AFA stainless steels, but why is not
￼understood. Unlike the Al-free Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb alloy studied by Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) and Chen et al. (2014), the addition of boron to a 32Ni grade alloy did not seem to have a significant effect on grain boundary precipitation, and in this case it was hypothesized that the boron addition formed a strain field in the matrix that increased resistance to creep deformation (Yamamoto, Muralidharan, Brady, 2013). It is worth noting that unlike the Al-free alloys in which a solutionizing anneal can completely dissolve the Laves phase precipitates, in the more complex alloys developed at ORNL solutionizing anneals still leave substantial volume fractions of the Laves phase in the material (Yamamoto, Muralidharan, Brady, 2013; Brady et al., 2014, Hu et al., 2014).
While computational methods have helped to design AFA alloys to limit the formation of deleterious phases, such as the sigma phase, and to help stabilize the austenitic matrix, it is clear that the additions of small alloying elements and their effect on the properties of AFA stainless steels require more detailed microstructural characterization. Even with an understanding of what phases may be present, creep mechanisms in this system are not well enough understood to predict which potential strengthening precipitate will be most beneficial for creep strength. For many of the AFA alloys that were also tensile tested, the creep and elevated temperature tensile properties did not correlate well. For example in the 20-25 Ni grade alloys while B2-NiAl and Laves precipitation improves tensile properties, MC carbides appear to show a stronger influence on the creep strength (Brady et al, 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2011). The ORNL group also questioned whether the Laves phase had any significant influence on the creep strength (Bei et al., 2010). The lower tensile strength they observed at 1023K compared to room temperature appeared to be due to the softening of the B2 NiAl phase which produces significant strengthening at room temperature.
In this work we are studying the effects of cold work on the simplified AFA stainless steel Fe-20Cr-30Ni- 2Nb-5Al (at. %) – many of the alloys studied by the ORNL Group are much more complex containing 10 or so elements (Brady et al., 2014). Cold rolling was performed after solution treatment at 1523 K to 25%, 50% and 90% rolling reduction with subsequent ageing performed for various times at 973K, 1073K and 1173 K. A significant density of dislocations was found in the matrix in the solutionized and aged specimens even without cold rolling, possibly due to the punching out of dislocations from around the precipitates during cooling, see Figure 2.
We found that cold work accelerated the precipitation kinetics of both C14-type Fe2Nb-type Laves phase and B2-type NiAl precipitates markedly compared to simply aging, presumably due to heterogeneous precipitation on dislocations, see Figure 3. It is worth noting that in the material that was simply aged the Laves phase precipitates nucleate before the B2 precipitates, but it is no longer clear that this sequence occurs after cold work and aging, see Figure 3. While often co-located, these two types of particles are distinct, see Figure 4. L12 (ordered f.c.c.) precipitates were also observed in samples aged at 973K with 90% prior cold work, see Figure 5, but not in specimens annealed at 1073K, which is in line with thermodynamic calculations. The additional fine L12 precipitates present at 973K are presumably the reason for the greater hardness of the 973K-annealed material, see Figure 6. We have shown using APT that the L12 precipitates are Ni3(Al,Ti), see Figure 7.

Compared to material that had not been strained, defects introduced by 50% and 90% cold work at 973K and 90% cold work at 1073K not only caused a more rapid precipitation in the matrix but also an increase in the total volume fraction of precipitates as compared to material that had been simply aged, see Figure 3. Histograms of the particle size distributions were produced for each annealing time and temperature (not shown here), and as might be expected they were log-normal with the particle size increasing steady with increasing time and increasing temperature (Trotter et al., 2014).

Similar to the accelerating effects of a boron addition on the Laves phase precipitation in Al-free Fe- 20Cr-30Ni-2Nb observed by Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) and Chen et al. (2014), we have found that the addition of silicon to an AFA-type alloy with a composition that despite having less Laves phase forming Nb (Fe-15Cr-23Ni-1.5Nb-7Al-0.2Si at. %) has increased precipitation kinetics, decreased precipitate size and an increase in the overall volume fraction of precipitates, in this case of both the Laves phase and NiAl precipitates (Trotter and Baker, unpublished), see Figure 8. As noted earlier, Yamamoto et al. (2008) found that Si additions produced a decrease in precipitate size and a greater volume fraction of
￼
￼precipitates.

The particles with light contrast are the Laves phase; the particles with dark contrast are NiAl. Trotter and Baker, unpublished research.
We have also examined the effects of simply aging on the room temperature tensile properties of Fe- 20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al and the results are quite dramatic, see Figure 9. After solutionizing for 24 h at 1523K the segregated as-cast microstructure was no longer visible and all the Laves phase precipitates had completely dissolved, see Figure 10. This material showed a yield strength of 205 MPa, an elongation to failure of 52% and a low work hardening rate of 256 MPa.
An anneal of 2.4 h at 1073K produced substantial coverage along the grain boundaries of fine alternating Laves phase and NiAl precipitates, but little obvious precipitation in the grains. This heat treatment produced a 57% increase in yield strength to 322 MPa with an increase in work-hardening rate, and a slight reduction in elongation to failure to 37%. It is noteworthy that for this heat-treatment there is a clear yield drop and a long Lüders region, see Figure 9.
Subsequent anneals increase the size and volume fraction of the precipitates both in the grain and on the grain boundaries, and lead to almost complete coverage of the grain boundaries after a 1325 h anneal, see Figure 10. These changes increase the yield strength and decrease the elongation, see Figure 9. The Lüders region on the stress-strain curves also disappears for the longer anneals. Interestingly, even though the grain boundaries are completely covered in brittle NiAl and Laves phase precipitates after the 1325h anneal, the material can still show 19% elongation.
We found that the orientation relationship between the Fe2Nb Laves phase precipitates and the austenite
matrix was (0001)Fe2Nb || (111)γ : [1010]Fe2Nb ||[110]γ, as proposed by Denham and Silcock (1969). The
B2 precipitates appear to show the Kurjamov-Sachs relationship with the matrix. In ongoing work, we are examining how cold work and aging affect the room temperature tensile properties.

As noted above the best current AFA stainless steel (referred to as 32ZCB) - 14Cr, 32.5Ni, 3Al, 0.14Si, 3Nb, 1.9Ti, 0.3Zr, 0.065C, 0.005B (in wt.%), balance Fe – which has L12 Ni3(Al,Ti), B2 (Ni,Fe)Al and C14 Fe2(Nb,Ti) Laves phase precipitates, has a creep-rupture life at a temperature of 1023K and a stress of 100 MPa that is an order of magnitude longer than that of the commercial iron-based superalloy A286 (Yamamoto, Muralidharan, Brady, 2013). While great progress has been made in the development of AFA stainless steels over the last few years, how the different precipitates and solutes control the high temperature strength is poorly understood. Based on the work presented above, there are some specific questions about effects of various components on the strength of AFA stainless steels:
1. Does the Laves phase affect the creep strength of AFA stainless steels? It is clear that the creep rate is related to the grain boundary coverage in Al-free Laves phase strengthened stainless steels (Tarigan et al. 2011, 2012; Chen et al., 2014), but whether the Laves phase precipitates contribute to the creep strength in AFA stainless steels in which fine L12 precipitates provide substantial strengthening is unclear (Bei et al., 2010).
2. Do aged alloys show better creep properties than simply solutionized alloys? Note that Yamamoto et al. (2008) found that solution treated Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb alloys with and without additions of 0.4 Si, 0.2 Zr or 5.0 Al (in at. %) crept at 1023 K and 100 MPa showed superior creep properties to those that were simply aged prior to creep testing, possibly because the particles that dynamically precipitated during creep were finer (300-400 nm) and, thus, more effective at pinning dislocations.
3. How does boron increase the creep life? For Al-free alloys, it simply appears to increase the Laves phase precipitation kinetics (Tarigan et al. 2011, 2012; Chen et al., 2014). Why boron increases the creep life in more complex AFA stainless steels that contain several different kinds of precipitates is unclear (Yamamoto, Muralidharan, Brady, 2013).
4. Is there any correlation between the room temperature or elevated temperature strength of various AFA stainless steels and their creep properties? A reason that there may not be is because the strengthening mechanisms can be quite different between room temperature and elevated temperature and because some alloys show dynamic strain aging (DSA) at elevated temperatures, see Figure 11.

￼PROPOSED RESEARCH
The research proposed here will attempt to elucidate the high temperature strengthening mechanisms in AFA stainless steels, and in particular we will attempt to answer the questions posed above. The work will use the model alloy Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al with and without 0.03% boron, which we have worked on previously and which can be fully solutionized upon annealing at 1523 K. A schematic of the microstructural features of the Laves phase-strengthened alumina-forming austenitic stainless steel is shown in Figure 12.
Figure 12: Schematic of the microstructure of a Laves phase- strengthened alumina-forming austenitic stainless steel. The f.c.c. matrix contains L12, B2 and Laves phase precipitates, while Laves phase precipitates and B2 precipitates also form along the grain boundaries. There is also a precipitate free zone (PFZ) along the grain boundaries.
We will undertake four series of elevated temperature mechanical tests as outlined below. In each series of tests, the microstructure will be carefully analyzed using a variety of techniques (see later) both before and after high temperature testing. A summary of microstructures examined in these series of tests is listed in Table 1 (some of these tests overlap with others).
1. We will anneal Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al for various times at 973K to produce different amounts of coverage of the Laves and NiAl precipitates along the grain boundaries, see Figure 10, and perform creep testing on the resulting material. (L12 precipitates are also present after annealing at 973K.) In this work, we will test the applicability of the empirical equation determined by Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) and corroborated by Chen et al. (2014) that the strain rate, ε, decreases with increasing
coverage of the grain boundaries by precipitates, ρ, according to: ε/ε0 = (1- ρ). A key difference from the work of Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) and Chen et al. (2014) is that in their work the grain boundary precipitates were only Laves phase (since their alloys did not contain Al), whereas the alloy tested here will have alternating Laves phase and B2 precipitates, and the latter will be soft at the test temperature. The extent of grain boundary coverage will be carefully determined.
2. We will compare the creep properties of the as-homogenized, fully solutionized base alloy, in which B2, Laves phase and L12 precipitation will occur during testing, with that of the 973K annealed alloys noted above that contain B2, Laves phase and L12 precipitates. In addition, we will anneal two specimens (24 h, 1325 h) at 1073K, which will contain B2 and Laves phase precipitates, in which L12 precipitation will occur during mechanical testing. One might expect that during creep testing both the fully solutionized alloy and the alloys initially without the L12 precipitates will show initial higher creep rates but that once precipitation occurs the creep rates will slow down. If finer precipitates are produced by creep testing rather than through simple aging, as suggested by Yamamoto et al. (2008), then we would expect the creep rate to be less for the as-homogenized alloy and the samples annealed at 1023K than the alloys in which 973 K aging was used to produce precipitates before creep testing. We will perform several interrupted creep tests on the as-solutionized and the aged alloys and analyze the microstructure using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a TEM in order to examine the microstructural evolution during creep.
We will perform creep tests in which we compare the effects of precipitation during creep by varying the presence of B2, Laves phase, and L12 in the starting microstructure. In the base case we will start from the fully solutionized base alloy, expecting all three precipitates to precipitate out during
￼
￼creep. We will then start from a 973K anneal where all precipitates are already present in the matrix before testing begins. Finally we will start from a 1073K anneal (24 h, 1325 h) with just Laves and B2 precipitates present in the starting microstructure and observe how subsequent L12 precipitation affects creep properties. One might expect that during creep testing both the fully solutionized alloy and the alloys initially without the L12 precipitates will show initial higher creep rates but that once precipitation occurs the creep rates will slow down. If finer precipitates are produced by creep testing rather than through simple aging, as suggested by Yamamoto et al. (2008), then we would expect the creep rate to be less for the as-homogenized alloy and the samples annealed at 1023K than the alloys in which 973 K aging was used to produce precipitates before creep testing. -mortem analysis of the crept samples will be analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a TEM to study precipitation effects.
3. We will compare the creep behavior of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al with and without 0.03% B after different anneals at 973K. We will determine whether the boron addition increases the precipitation kinetics as in the similar but Al-free alloys studied by Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) and Chen et al. (2014). The key question is whether boron reduces the creep rate and increases the creep life and, if so, whether this is simply due to increased precipitation at the grain boundaries. We will determine the segregation of boron using EPMA and APT, in particular whether the boron is associated with the grain boundary, the B2 precipitates or the Laves phase precipitates.
4. We will compare several specimens of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al with and without 0.03% B either simply aged or cold-worked and aged to give different room-temperature mechanical properties and tensile test them at different strain rates at 973K to determine if dynamic strain aging occurs. We will then perform creep tests to determine if we can relate the creep behavior to the displacement-controlled tensile tests performed at room temperature or at 973K.

Casting
Alloys of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al with and without boron will be produced by arc-melting from elemental constituents under an argon atmosphere. Each alloy will be flipped over and remelted twice to ensure homogeneity, following our standard practice. After a solutioninzing treatment at 1523K a material with a grain size of ~800 μm is obtained. The compositions of the ingots will be confirmed using an EPMA via a collaboration with Prof. Paul R. Munroe of the University of New South Wales, Australia, a collaborator for over twenty years. The boron content of the ingots will be determined via chemical analysis using a commercial vendor.
Microstructural Analysis
Microstructural characterization of the alloy will be performed using a combination of state-of-the-art techniques and instruments both before and after testing. To fully characterize the microstructure of the precipitate structure of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al-(B), the following parameters will be determined:
￼- precipitate size and spacing.
- lattice parameters of the phases, and, hence the misfit parameters and interface strains; - microchemistry of and around the precipitates.
Four techniques will be used for microstructural characterization:
- We will use a Rigaku rotating anode X-ray set to precisely measure lattice parameters.
- Backscattered electron imaging on FEI XL30 field emission gun (FEG) SEM will be used to get an
overview of the precipitate size and distribution, as performed in Trotter et al. (2014).
- Conventional diffraction-contrast TEM will be performed on a FEI Tecnai FEG 200 keV TEM to determine the details of the morphology of the phases. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and both selected area diffraction (SAD) and convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) analysis will also be performed using this instrument to obtain the chemistry and orientation relationships of the phases. Higher Order Lower Zone line shifts in the transmitted disc in CBED patterns will be used to assess strains in the phases.
- APT will be utilized to examine the grain boundary chemistry. Grain boundary specimens will be cut out using a FEI Nova 200 Nanolab focused ion beam microscope (FIB) using lift-out and annular milling methods [Miller, 2000]. The resulting specimens, will be examined with a voltage-pulsed Imago Scientific Instruments local electrode atom probe (LEAP®), which provides high-speed data acquisition over a large field of view, at the University of Sydney, Australia through a long time collaborator Prof. Simon P. Ringer. We will also determine whether the boron is associated with a particular type of precipitate at the grain boundaries.
- In collaboration with Prof. Paul R. Munroe, an EPMA located at the University of New South Wales, will also be used to obtain determine whether boron segregates to the grain boundaries as observed by Chen et al. (2014).
Mechanical Testing
Mechanical Testing will take two forms, viz, displacement-controlled tensile tests and constant-stress creep tests. Tensile tests will be performed for test series 4 noted above at 973K at a range of strain rates from 1 x 10-6 s-1 to 1 s-1 in air, in order to examine the strain rate sensitivity, including determining whether dynamic strain aging occurs.
We will perform constant-stress creep tests for all the test series noted above at 973K at a stress of 140 MPa in air. Most reported tests of AFA stainless steels have been at temperature from 923- 1033K and at stresses form 100-250 MPa, the higher stresses being associated with testing at lower temperatures. We chose 973K and 140 MPa since this will allow direct comparison to the Al-free Laves phase strengthened stainless steels studied by Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012). This temperature is also one of likely first commercial use. While the stress is somewhat higher than the stress that the alloys might be used at, it will result in creep tests that lead to failure in a reasonable length of time (a few hundred hours). Most creep testing will be performed at Dartmouth on a home-built constant-stress creep rig, whose design was based on that of Garofalo, Richmond and Domis (1962). However because of the length of time creep tests require, Prof. Min Song at Central South University, Changsha, PRC will also perform some creep tests for us. Prof. Song obtained his Ph.D. at Dartmouth working with the author, who has had collaborations with Central South University for several years and has hosted two exchange students in his laboratory for two years each.
Deformation Mechanisms
Three approaches will be used to examine the deformation mechanisms:
- Post-mortem TEM dislocation analysis will be performed using the Tecnai FEG TEM on specimens that have been crept at 973 K. Of particular interest is whether there has been a change in precipitate
￼size and spacing, and how these precipitates interact with dislocations. Previous reports on crept Laves-Phase-strengthened austenitic steels have suggested that the Laves phase precipitates become smaller during creep (Yamamoto et al., 2008).
- TEM in-situ straining experiments will be performed at 973 K in order to observe the fundamental dislocation/precipitate interactions directly. It is worth noting that if dislocation cutting of the precipitates occurs, this will likely lead to mechanical dissolution of the precipitates and their re-precipitation. The TEM in-situ straining studies will be performed on the Tecnai FEG TEM for which the P.I. has a Gatan single-tilt, hot-straining stage (operates to 1273 K) and a video system. Of particular interest is whether dislocations impinging on the grain boundary behave differently when they encounter a B2 precipitate rather than a Laves phase precipitate – as noted earlier, Tarigan et al. (2011, 2012) suggested that the role of the grain boundary Laves phase was to suppress deformation at the grain boundaries. It is important to correlate the in-situ straining experiments with the post-mortem TEM analysis. The latter can provide Burgers vector information, but always has the possibility that the dislocations have rearranged themselves (particularly after high temperature deformation) so that one does not see the real line direction of the gliding dislocations. It is worth noting that the P.I. has several year’s experience with TEM in-situ straining experiments (Baker, Horton and Schulson,1987; Baker, Schulson and Horton, 1987; Baker, Guha and Horton, 1993; Baker, and Horton, 1993; Baker et al., 1991; Baker and Liu, 1994; Horton, Baker and Yoo, 1991; Nagpal and Baker, 1991; Nagpal, Baker and Horton, 1994; Loudis and Baker, 2008; Liao and Baker, 2008; Liao and Baker, 2011a, 2011b), including recent work by Liao and Baker (2011a, 2011b) where TEM in situ straining observations were able to quantitatively explain the yield anomaly observed in Fe2MnAl.
- We will use secondary electron imaging in a SEM to examine fracture surfaces. Analysis of the Results
As an initial effort we will examine the creep model of Rösler and Artz (1990) for a particle-containing material. In this model, the strain rate, ε, at an applied stress of σ is described by

temperature, k is the ratio of the line energy of a dislocation segment at a particle interface to its line

The P.I.’s has past experience in developing deformation models e.g. on the role of both grain boundaries and particles on the ductility of Intermetallic compounds (Baker and Schulson, 1989; Baker, 1999); a well-accepted model for the yield anomaly in B2 FeAl (George and Baker, 1998); and a model for strain- induced ferromagnetism in intermetallic compounds (Yang, Baker and Martin, 1999; Wu, Munroe and Baker, 2003).

Abstract 
Alloyed with aluminum to provide corrosion resistance, alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels have shown promise for application in the harsh environments seen in energy production where strong materials that are oxidation and corrosion resistant are needed.  The role of precipitates in AFA-type alloys, Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al and DAFA26 was investigated in this study.
            The effects of cold work on the microstructural evolution during aging of solutionized Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %), was investigated.  Cold work prior to aging at either 700°C or 800°C facilitated the heterogeneous precipitation of both Laves phase and B2-type NiAl precipitates.  While often co-located after cold work, these particles were distinct. γ’-Ni3Al precipitates were also observed in samples aged at 700°C with 90% prior cold work. Compared to material that had not been strained, defects introduced by 50 and 90% cold work at 700°C and 90% cold work at 800°C not only caused a more rapid precipitation in the matrix but also an increase in the total volume fraction of precipitates as compared to material that had been simply aged.
The effect of aging on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) was evaluated.  An increase in the volume fraction of B2 and Laves phase precipitates in the alloy was accompanied by an increase in the yield strength from 205 MPa after the solutionizing anneal up to 383 MPa after aging at 800°C for 1325 h.  After aging for 1325 h, even with extensive intermetallic grain boundary coverage, the alloy showed a room temperature elongation of 19%.
The relationship between the crystallographic orientation of Laves Fe2Nb and B2-NiAl precipitates and their f.c.c. parent matrix was investigated.  Four variants of the #m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p orientation relationship proposed by Denham and Silcock (J. Iron Steel Inst. 207 (1969) 582) were observed for the Laves phase, and six variants of the ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship were observed for the B2-NiAl phase.
	The microstructural evolution of DAFA26 was also observed.  In addition to Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates, the evolution of the Ni3Al precipitates present in this alloy was investigated.

1.1 Background
Alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels (AFAs) are a new promising class of steels with potential for use in a number of energy-conversion applications [1-10].  For example, currently there is an effort to develop systems requiring power plant materials that can work in the ultra super critical (USC) range of 760C/ 35 MPa.  These materials must have excellent creep and corrosion resistance.  Increasing the operating temperature improves efficiency with the added benefit of reducing CO2 emissions [11-14].  The relatively low cost of ferritic steels make them desirable candidates, but they have yet to show the creep strength and oxidation resistance needed at high temperatures.  Nickel-based superalloys can be used at temperatures in excess of 760°C, but their higher cost, correlated with higher Ni content, makes them less desirable for most applications [13, 14].  In order for an AFA to be a viable alternative, it must have a strength and creep resistance that are close to, or exceeds that, of Ni-based alloys.  AFAs have relied on MC carbides for strength [1, 3, 4, 15], but at temperatures greater than 800C there is concern that the carbides formed could coarsen and dissolve [4].  Even with an inlet steam temperature to the turbine of 700-760 ºC, the average metal temperature in superheater and reheater parts could run up to 815 ºC [16]. 
Alumina (Al2O3)-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels have the potential to decrease our reliance on expensive Ni-base alloys for aggressive conditions in energy production and chemical processing environments  [17].  AFAs use alumina as a protective oxide scale for high corrosion resistance instead of chromia.  Alumina is known to offer even better protection than chromia at high temperatures [18, 19].  AFA stainless steels were in development as early as the 70s [20] and more recently a new family of AFAs has received attention [1, 3, 9, 10, 17].  In the newer grades of AFAs, the single-phase austenitic microstructure needed for creep strength can be obtained, and MC-base precipitates or γ’-Ni3Al have been used for creep strength [9, 10, 17].  Unfortunately, optimization of these alloys is difficult because the effects that different alloying elements and precipitates have on the creep strength of these steels is complex and oftentimes, not well understood.  AFAs have a wide composition range and continued study of this system is needed to find the optimal combination of alloying elements that provide the best effectiveness (e.g. superior creep strength) with a balance of cost for future commercialization [17].  
Even when isolating research efforts to focus on understanding particular grades of AFAs, it can be difficult to understand the influence of precipitate phases on creep strength. is difficult.  Phases that are beneficial in some cases can cause decreased creep strength in others.  There are generally 3 grades of AFAs that are being investigatedunder investigation, based on nickel content: 20-25 wt. % Ni grade AFA, 12Ni grade AFA, and 32Ni grade AFA.   Substituting Ni with Mn to achieve the 12Ni grade AFAs has been explored since Mn helps to stabilize austenite relative to the deleterious δ–Fe phase and would be an ideal Ni substitute to lower cost.  However, this grade of AFAs with Mn has shown relatively poor creep resistance although and the reason for the decreased creep strength is not well understood [10, 17].   In 20-25 Ni grade alloys it has been found that the total weight fraction of carbide phases as well as supersaturation is important.  For example, a 25Ni grade alloy with 2.53 wt. % Nb (0.201 wt. % C) there was little MC supersaturation and it showed poor creep resistance compared to 25Ni grade alloys with 1wt. % Nb and 0.1 wt. % C.  It is believed that the 2.53 wt. % Nb alloy showed poorer creep strength because the 2.53 wt. % Nb addition decreased the supersaturation of MC carbides (M is primarily Nb) [17].  Thise 1 wt. % Nb and 0.1wt. % C level range has been shown to be an optimal saturation range for MC carbide strengthening in other studies of AFAs as well [3, 7].  While increased Nb content from 1wt. % to 2.5 wt. % seemed to have a detrimental role in creep strength for a 25Ni alloy, in the 32Ni grade alloys with 3.3 Nb wt. %, superior creep strength has been observed at 650ºC.  The superior creep strength is considered to be caused by γ’-Ni3Al precipitate strengthening.  This level of creep strength is around 5x greater than the best carbide strengthened 20-25 Ni alloy.  While γ’-Ni3Al improved properties in the 32Ni alloy, at 650°C it is believed that metastable γ’-Ni3Al  caused decreased rupture time in a 25Ni-4Al-1Nb alloy with increased C content compared to a 25Ni-3Al-1Nb alloy. Though the creep strength was promising there was a tradeoff, and the 32Ni grade alloy saw reduced creep elongation which is thought to be due to σ-phase formation that needs to be addressed.  At 750ºC, the 32Ni alloy creep results were comparable to the 20-25 and 12Ni alloy grades [17]. 
Work to increase γ’-Ni3Al stability and decrease σ-phase stability has been done in 32Ni grade alloys.  32Ni alloys with decreased chromium content (14 wt. % versus 19 wt. %) and additional alloying elements such as Zr and Ti have less σ-phase formation and improved creep properties.  A 32 Ni grade alloy with Zr and Ti and small additions of carbon and boron had a creep-rupture life that exceeded that of a commercially available Fe-base alloy by an order of magnitude [21].  The mechanisms that allow for the improvement in creep properties with boron addition in AFAs are not well understood. A Laves phase strengthened austenitic alloy with a similar base composition of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at. %) had improved creep properties with the addition of boron due to an increase in Laves phase grain boundary precipitation [22-24], but in the 32Ni grade AFAs studied, the boron addition did not seem to have a significant effect on grain boundary precipitation.  It was hypothesized that the boron addition formed a strain field in the matrix that increased resistance to creep deformation [21].  While computational methods have helped to limit deleterious phases such as the sigma phase and to help achieve an austenitic matrix, it has been made clear that the additions of small alloying elements and their effect on the properties of AFAs needs to be characterized using advanced characterization techniques such as the TEM and the atom probe.  Even with an understanding of what phases may be present, creep mechanisms in this system are not well understood enough to predict which potential strengthening precipitate is the most beneficial for creep strength.  For many of the AFA alloys that have also been tensile tested, it is hard to find correlation between creep and tensile properties.  For example in 20-25 Ni grade AFA, while B2-NiAl and Laves precipitation is thought to improve tensile properties, it is the presence of MC carbides would showthat has a strong influence on creep strength [10, 17].  
HTUPS (high-temperature ultrafine-precipitation-strengthened steel) alloys, modified for Al2O3 formation, a precursor to AFAs [1, 25], {Yamamoto, 2007 #1}as well as an AFA-type alloy [15] have been cold worked to enhance the precipitation of nanoscale MC carbide precipitates during creep to improve creep resistance.  Nucleation on dislocations haveNucleation on dislocations has been shown to be a possible route to reduce the size and increase the volume fraction of these precipitates in the matrix so that they effectively pin dislocations and extend creep life.  Previous studies of other materials have used pre-straining via cold work and subsequent aging to control particle precipitation [26-28]. 

1.2 Common AFA precipitates
1.2.1 C-14 Laves phase
The AB2-type Laves phase generally exists as one of three topologically close-packed (TCP) structures: hexagonal MgZn2 (C14), cubic MgCu2 (C15) and hexagonal MgNi2 (C36) [29].  The A atom is the larger of the two atoms [30].  The space group of the C14 structure is P63/mmc. Figure 1.1 shows a schematic of the C14 structure. 
￼
Figure 1.1: Hexagonal C14 Fe2Nb (AB2) Laves phase structure. The large yellow spheres represent Nb (A atoms) and the smaller black spheres represent Fe (B atoms).

The stacking of the C14 structure along the (0001) planes is similar to the ABAB stacking sequence for hcp structures [31].  For the Laves phase, there are 6 fundamental four-layer stacking schemes that can be combined to form the Laves phase structure as described by Komura [32] and 2 make up the C14 structurpolytype.  The two layers form in the close-packed direction and follow an AB’AB’-pattern or a stacking sequence of: αAαcßBßc… where αAαc represents the ‘A’ and ßBßc represents the ‘B’’ in the pattern as shown in Figure 1.2 [33]. 
 ￼

Even though Laves phase has been shown to be harmful in some ferritic steels [34], decreasing toughness and strength and  precipitating at the grain boundary, there has been little research into its presence in austenitic steels [35].  In a study of a quartenaryquaternary Fe-20Cr-(25-40)Ni-(2-4)Nb (at. %) system Takeyama et al. [36]  observed fine, spherical C14 precipitates in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at. %) and Fe-20Cr-25Ni-2Nb (at. %)  noting that the morphology of the precipitates became finer with a lower nickel content [35].  When Takeyama et al. examined quarternaryquaternary alloys of Fe-20Cr-(25-35)Ni-2Nb (at. %) they observed that with an increased nickel content of 35 at. % the Fe2Nb precipitates were elongated with visible interfacial dislocations, but with 25 at. % nickel the precipitates were smaller and more equiaxed.  They also looked at the precipitation of Laves phase on the grain boundary and within the grain for the Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at. %) system after aging.  They constructed a Time-Temperature-Precipitation (TTP) diagram and found that after aging for 4.32 Ms at 800°C Laves phase particles also precipitated homogeneously in the matrix with grain boundary precipitates being larger than those in the matrix. The TTP also showed much slower precipitation kinetics at 700°C. Takeyama’s analysis indicated that the formation of the Laves phase was diffusion controlled by the Nb in austenite [37].  In 316 austenitic stainless steels, it was speculated that an acceleration of intermetallic precipitation could occur due to the speeding up of substitutional diffusion via an increased defect concentration.  Laves-phase precipitation was accelerated after cold work and it was hypothesized that it was the result of increased diffusivity of elements that made up the Laves phase [38].   

1.2.2 B2-NiAl
The AB B2-NiAl phase has a cubic CsCl crystal structure (Figure 1.3).  The space group of the B2 structure is￼.  The B2-NiAl structure can be treated as two interpenetrating simple cubic lattices consisting of A and B atoms  A-type atoms are positioned at the (0, 0, 0) corner site and B atoms are at the (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) center site [39].
￼
Figure 1.3:  B2-NiAl structure.  The purple spheres represent nickel “A” atoms occupying the corner sites and the smaller blue sphere in the center site represents the aluminum “B” atom.
B2 particles are spherical in some materials such as precipitation-hardenable martensitic stainless steels [40] and have also shown plate-like morphology in Fe-Ni-Cr-Al (FNCA) alloys [41, 42].  Stoichiometric B2-NiAl has been extensively studied and polycrystalline NiAl is generally seen as being brittle at room temperature with a sharp increase in ductility above 0.45 Tm [43].  B2 precipitates in AFAs have shown similarities to the bulk NiAl alloys, being strong but brittle at room temperature and showing ductility and decreased strengthening effects at 750°C, above the ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) [44].
1.2.3 L12 Ni3Al
The L12 (AuCu3) structure is cubic with formula A3B is an ordered f.c.c. structure (Figure 1.4). The space group of the L12 structure is ￼.  The L12 Ni3Al phase is known as gamma prime (γ’).  In superalloys it is used as a strengthener.  Al atoms make up the corners of the structure and Ni atoms make up the face center [45].  The Ni3(Al,Ti) L12 phase has been shown to have strengthening effects in AFAs [21].

1.2.4 Nucleation of Precipitates
Nucleation on dislocations was modeled by Cahn [46] in 1957 and occurs because it lowers strain energy .  The strain contrast that is present in TEM images of Fe2Nb that has precipitated in austenite in Fe-20Cr-35Ni-2Nb and Fe-20Cr-25Ni-2Nb after aging at 800ºC [37] is indicative of a semi-coherent precipitate-matrix interface and is thought to be a reason why the Laves phase has shown stability during aging and creep testing at 800 ºC [47].  According to Denham and Silcock [48] Fe2Nb shows only a moderate misfit in austenite with 5% contraction perpendicular to the ￼planes and a 9% expansion within.  Weatherly described a mechanism where prismatic punching could cause the nucleation of dislocations [49].  In a ferritic alloy parallel plate precipitates were believed to have been caused by an autocatalytic reaction.  It was proposed that precipitates may have formed on quenched in dislocations and then caused new dislocations to form and act as nucleation sites [50].  
	Heterogeneous nucleation often does not solely occur on dislocations, but also takes place on grain boundaries since the grain boundary activation energy is lower than that for nucleation on a dislocation.  For a grain size of 50 µm and a sufficient dislocation density (1 x 1016 m-2) the number of atoms on the grain boundary versus dislocation nucleation sites is comparable.  If the energy reduction that would occur by precipitating on a grain boundary is small, precipitation on dislocations can make up a large fraction of total precipitation [51].  
1.3 Creep for Dispersion-Strengthened Materials
         In 1988 Rösler and Artz proposed that dislocation attachment might be thermally activated [52] and in 1990 [53] they revisited the predominant creep equation used at the time and proposed a new model of the creep behavior of dispersion-strengthened alloys that took this thermal activation into account in order to understand the ‘unusual’ behavior of dispersion-strengthened alloys: 
￼

where ￼ is the strain rate, 2λ is the mean free path between obstacles (~ the distance between particles), ρ is the density of dislocations, b is the Burger’s vector, D is the self-diffusion coefficient, G is the shear modulus, r is the particle radius, k is the relaxation parameter (0 ≤ k ≤ 1), σ is the engineering stress and σd is (1-k2)1/2σOr with σOr being the Orowan stress required to escape the particles, kB is the Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the temperature.  Using this model they were able to show that one could predict an optimum particle size with a given volume fraction.  Since dispersion-strengthened alloys use particles under 100 nm in size, the 300- 500 nm sized Fe2Nb particles that have been attained thus far would be more beneficial if they were refined further [9]. 
1.4 Orientation Relationships
1.4.1 Fe2Nb Denham and Silcock Orientation Relationship
The orientation relationship(OR) between Laves phase particles and the f.c.c. matrix in AFAs has not been studied extensively.  The relationship observed by Denham and Silcock [48] for Laves phase precipitates in an f.c.c. alloy with Fe, Cr, Ni, Nb and other minor constituents, and also in a Fe-16.2Cr-14.3Ni-1.2Nb (at. %)  alloy with minor alloying additions [54] was determined to be:
(0001)Fe2Nb // (111)γ
￼Fe2Nb // ￼γ

Though this orientation relationship appears to be the most observed between C14 Laves and austenitic structures, others are possible within austenite.  In a study of the Laves phase orientation with that of ferrite, for example,, different orientation relationships were observed and was proposed to have a significant effect on particle morphology [55].

1.4.2 B2-NiAl Kurdjumov-Sachs Orientation Relationship
The Kurdjumov-Sachs (K-S) orientation relationships (OR) is one of the ORs that can be observed in the study of austenite-martensite transformations [56].  This OR is described as:
￼ 
￼.
24 different variants are possible in this orientation relationship since austenite has 4 ￼ planes and each ￼ plane contains 3 different &lt;110&gt; directions that can be parallel to 2 different bcc-α &lt;111&gt; directions [57].
The orientation relationship of B2-NiAl particles wasere observed to follow the K-S orientation relationship in an Fe-Ni-Cr-Al (FNCA) alloy [41, 42] with B2-NiAl precipitates that had a plate-like morphology.  In that case, two K-S orientation relationship variants were observed.  In a study of f.c.c. Co precipitates in a B2-ordered (Ni,Co)Al alloy [58], 3 variants of the K-S orientation relationship were observed and it was noted that the ratio of the lattice parameters of the f.c.c and b.c.c. phase can influence the orientation relationship.  	
1.5 Overview of research project
The Laves phase Fe2Nb and B2-NiAl precipitates commonly found in AFAs can strongly influence the material properties.  Intermetallic Fe2Nb Laves-phase precipitates have shown long-term stability at high temperature and have the potential to further improve the performance of alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) alloys.  Further refinement of Fe2Nb precipitates could allow these materials to meet the demand for even better creep life and high temperature strength.  The insights gained from an understanding of the fundamental and underlying causes of mechanical and microstructural responses observed in a model AFA alloy, Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al can be extended to different classes of AFAs, as well as other austenitic stainless steels with complex matrix-precipitate relationships.  
In chapter 3 the effect of cold Work on the Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-Al is described with a discussion of observed microstructural change and precipitate evolution as the material is aged.
Chapter 4 focuses on the microstructure of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al under different aging conditions in order to understand the effects of aging on the precipitation of Fe2Nb Laves phase as well as B2-NiAl precipitates.  The effect of these precipitates on the mechanical properties of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-Al is determined.

Chapter 5 details the orientation relationship observed between the Laves phase and NiAl particles and the austenitic matrix.
In Chapter 6 the microstructure of an AFA alloy, DAFA26, is also observed and the evolution of NiAl, Laves phase and L12 precipitates is described.

















Chapter 2  Experimental Methods

2.1 Introduction
This chapter details the materials processing methods and techniques involved in this work.  
2.2 Materials Preparation
2.2.1 Vacuum Arc Melting
Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (compositions expressed in atomic percent) was investigated.  Professor Easo George provided Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al ingots that had been arc melted and drop cast into a copper mold 15.2 cm long x 2.5 cm in diameter under argon.  Common cast features [59] were observed: there was some segregation and a central pore was created during the solidification process.  Samples were also prepared by Sophisticated Alloy, Inc and vacuum arc melted into 200 g buttons.
Fe-14Cr-25Ni-2.5Nb-0.1Si-3.6Al (wt. %) samples were prepared by arc melting at Thayer in a Centorr Associates, Inc. 5BJ bell jar furnace.  ~50-60 g samples were made from pieces of 99.97+%  Fe, 99.99% Cr, 99.95+% Ni, 99.9% Al, and 99.9999%  Si.  Pieces were put into a water-cooled copper crucible and arc melted in an argon atmosphere to prevent oxidation.  After being melted, the sample was flipped and re-melted at least twice to ensure it was well-mixed.




2.2.2 Sectioning and Machining
Samples that were arc-melted went through processing to prepare them for materials characterization.  Samples were sectioned using one of two saws: a high-speed, custom-built saw with a water-cooled aluminum oxide cutoff wheel was used for rough cutting of bulk samples, and.  A a water-cooled low speed South Bay Technology, Inc. Model 650 diamond saw was used for precise cutting of smaller samples.  A Trak DPM SX3P Bed Mill with Proto TRAK SMX Control along with two and three-axis control was used for machining samples.

2.2.3 Homogenization
Arc melted samples were homogenized for 24 hours at 1250ºC using a Lindberg Type 54233 7200 watt closed-shell tube furnace with a max temperature of 1500ºC.  A Lindberg Type 59545 controller was used to control the temperature.  36” long alumina tubes with a 2” outer diameter, 1-3/4” inner diameter, were used in the furnace.  Samples were placed in alumina crucibles and loaded into the center of the alumina tube.  An MTI vacuum sealing assembly made of stainless steel was placed on either side of the tube andwith had  a vacuum meter with valve on one end.  Porous alumina blocks were placed inside either end of the tube in order to prevent the melting of the rubber O-rings of the vacuum sealing assembly.  The assembly was altered at one end to include an Omega type R thermocouple which was shielded by an alumina sheath and monitored by an Omega Dpi32 themocouplethermocouple meter.  A vacuum was obtained using an Edward E2M1.5 oil sealed rotary vane pump.  After loading a sample and closing the vacuum assembly, the tube was flushed with argon and a ~0.02 MPa pressure was maintained to prevent oxidation of the sample.  After a homogenization treatment samples were quickly removed and water-quenched.  
The 1250°C homogenization temperature was chosen after consideration of the quaternary tetrahedron of the Fe-Cr-Ni-Nb quaternary system at 1200°C (Figure 2.1a) as well as from illustrations of the phase equilibria (Figure 2.1b) as a function of Ni and Nb with 20 % Cr content in Fe-Cr-Ni-Nb which was described by Takeyama and others [36].   Based on the quaternary system and phase equilibria illustrations, increasing the Ni content increases the ability for the Fe-Cr-Ni-Nb system to form a single phase γ-matrix at 1200°C.  For Fe-20Cr-25Ni-2Nb-5Al at. %, a single phase microstructure was not achieved after a 24 h heat treatment at 1250°C, but when the Ni content in increased to 30 at.  % (Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al at. %), a single phase microstructure can be obtained.

2.2.4 Annealing
Samples were annealed at 700 and 800ºC for 10 min to 3000 hours using a Thermolyne Type 47900 box furnace.  The samples were put inside alumina crucibles, annealed in air, and water-quenched at the end of the heating treatment.  

2.2.5 Cold Work
To cold work samples, an International Rolling Mills/Mario Di Maio Type LS200 two-high 4.2” rolling mill was used.  Specimens were milled to 4 mm x 4 mm x ~13mm, and some were cold-rolled with approximately a 0.3 mm reduction per pass until the desired thickness reduction (50 or 90% ±1%) was achieved.  

2.3 Materials Characterization
2.3.1 X-ray diffraction 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on bulk samples using a Rigaku D/Max 2000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm) to examine bulk samples and the effects of aging on precipitate evolution.  A tube voltage of 40 kV and anode current of 300 mA was used.  Measurements were performed by scanning from 20° to 120° using a step size of 0.01° with a count time of 1 s per step giving a total scan time of ~3 h.  The bulk samples were cut from treated ingots and polished with successively finer grits of silicon carbide paper, up to 1200-grit SiC paper and with 0.3 and 0.05 µm alumina powder in water to obtain a mirror finish.  Jade software was used to identify phases in the alloys and to analyze the diffraction patterns.


2.3.2 Metallography
Grain size determination was done by polishing samples to a mirror finish and then etching in an immersion of Kalling’s Reagent, which is a solution of CuCl2, HNO3, ethanol, and water.  (Figure 2.2).  Grains were examined and measured using a light microscope equipped with a digital camera (Figure 2.2).  .

2.3.3 Scanning electron microscopy
Microstructures were examined using a FEI XL30 field emission gun (FEG) scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated at 15 kV and equipped with an electron backscatter detector (EBSD) and an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The EDS system used a lithium-drifted silicon, thin-window, Z ￼ 4 detector with an acquisition rate of up to 10,000 counts per second.  A working distance of 10 mm was used for both imaging and EDS.  Samples were observed under high vacuum (~8 x 10-9 torr) and using either secondary electron (SE) or back-scattered electron (BSE) imaging.  

2.3.4 Transmission electron microscopy 
An EDS-equipped FEI Tecnai FS20ST FEG TEM operated at 200 kV was used to examine transmission electron microscope (TEM) specimens. TEM samples were made by cutting rectangular bars and milling them into 3 mm diameter cylinders.  Disks were then cut out from the cylindrical rods.  These discs were mechanically thinned and polished to ~100µm thick and electropolished using a Struers TenuPol-5 twin-jet electropolisher at a voltage of 11 V with a current of ~180 mA using an electrolyte of 25 % nitric acid in methanol at -20°C.  The thin foils were placed in a conventional double-tilt holder with a capability of tilting 60º along two axes for observation.   

2.3.5 Diffraction Analysis
Experimental selected area diffraction patterns were simulated using CrystalMaker® 9.1.3 and SingleCrystal® 2.3.1 software.  Pattern indexing and lattice parameter determination was calculated using MDI Jade 2010 software.
2.3.6 Atom Probe Tomography
Atom probe tomography (APT) work was supported through the SHaRE program through collaboration with Dr. M.K. Miller and Dr. Lan Yao at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS), sponsored by the Scientific User Facilities Divisions, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy.
A Cameca Instruments local electrode atom probe (LEAP), was used to study the 3D morphology of metallic samples and to better understand the composition profile of phases and the overall sample (Figure 2.3). 



￼
Figure 2.3:  LEAP 4000X HR used to make 3D observations and determine composition profiles of samples.
Figure 2.4 shows a diagram that illustrates the basics of atom probe tomography. The LEAP operates in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and contains three-chambers, one of which includes a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ToFMS).  The ToFMS includes the specimen, the local electrode, and crossed delay line detector that detects the ions extracted from the specimen [60].  The atom probe is essentially a combination of a field ion microscope and a mass spectrometer.  In the LEAP a needle-shaped specimen is mounted facing a local electrode (LE) on a nanopositioning stage that is cryogenically cooled. The local electrode is placed approximately one aperture diameter away (20-50 µm).   A high voltage pulse is applied so that ions are field evaporated from the specimen. Layer-by-layer, ions that are field evaporated are collected and analyzed in the ToFMS [61].

￼

Specimens were annularly milled in an FEI Nova 200 dual beam focused ion beam (FIB)-SEM after electropolishing in a solution of 2 % perchorlic acid in 2-butoxyethanol.  Some samples were also fabricated by annular milling and a lift-out procedure (Figure 2.5) [63].  After sample preparation LEAP analyses were performed in voltage mode at a specimen temperature of 50 K (-223ºC), a pulse fraction of 0.2, and a pulse repetition rate of 200 kHz.

￼

Atom maps, isoconcentration surfaces, and proximity histograms are common methods for analyzing atom probe data.  Isoconcentration surfaces can be used to better understand the morphology and distribution of phases [62].  Proximity histograms, as described by Hellman et. al [64], were constructed from isoconcentration surfaces. Proximity histograms are useful for detecting concentration variations between interfaces.   The proximity histogram is constructed such that an interface is created between two phases and the closest distance of an atom to either side of a reference surface is plotted as a function of distance from the interface [65].  

2.4 Vickers hardness testing
Samples were mounted into pucks made of a phenolic resin and then polished to a mirror finish.  Hardness tests were performed using a TIME TH-713 Microhardness Tester.  Tests were performed using a load of 1.96 N (200g) and a 15 second dwell time at room temperature.  At least 10 indents were made for each condition and the standard deviation of the averages is reported.
2.5 Tensile testing
Flat, dog-bone tensile specimens approximately 1.27 mm thick, with an overall length of 12.7 mm, and gauge length of 10 mm were prepared by milling followed by sectioning on a high-speed saw.  The specimens were polished up to 1200-grit SiC paper and finished with 0.3 µm alumina powder to eliminate surface defects.  Tensile tests were conducted in air at room temperature using an MTS or Instron model 5969 at an initial strain rate of 5 x 10-4 s-1.  Up to four tests were performed for each aging condition.  Samples were preloaded prior to testing.   Figure 2.6 shows the new tensile sample holder that was designed for room-temperature tests.  The new holder improved sample stability during testing, prevented tensile samples from falling out during the loading process, and decreased the number of repeat tests that had to be performed due to samples not breaking along the gauge length.  Figure 2.6d shows the dimensions of a typical tensile specimen.  Percent elongation was determined from measurements of the gauge length of specimens taken before and after fracture using an optical microscope.

True strain () and true stress (σ) were calculated from the load-displacement data and the work-hardening exponent was determined using the Hollomon equation [66]: σ = K(n, where K is the strength coefficient that is equal to the true stress when ɛ  = 1, and n is the strain-hardening exponent.  This equation can be rewritten log(σ) = log(K) + nlog(). Thus, by plotting log(σ) versus log() for the uniform plastic deformation range, and fitting a straight line to the data, n can be determined from the slope, i.e. n = dlog(σ)/dlog().  For materials with inhomogeneous yielding, the plastic portion is considered starting from the lower yield point.  

2.6 Image Analysis
SEM images taken at 8000x were processed and analyzed using ImageJ [67].  BSE images were used for particle analysis since BSE atomic number contrast allowed for optimal differentiation and detection of the matrix, Laves phase, and NiAl precipitates.  The image processing routine included contrast enhancement followed by thresholding to include bright or dark contrasted regions to delineate Laves or NiAl particles, respectively.  Images were then despeckled and outlier filters were run and small artifacts removed in the final binarized image.  The particle parameters calculated include area fraction and equivalent circle diameter given as 2(A/π)1/2), of a circle with equivalent area A .  SEM resolution limits and image quality was ere taken into account in order to minimize error.  Segmented areas that had low pixel counts that corresponded to particles with a diameter smaller than 20-60nm were excluded from the results. 
The particle nearest-neighbor distance, λ was determined for each aging condition from the equation [68] :
￼ 
where PA is the particle density or point density and is equal to the particle count divided by the area of the image field of view [69].  Grain boundary coverage was calculated using BSE images.  The percent coverage was found by subtracting segments of the grain boundary devoid of Laves and NiAl precipitates from the total grain boundary length and then dividing by the total grain boundary length. 



Chapter 3  Effect of Cold Work on the Microstructure of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al alloy
3 
This chapter is largely derived from: G. Trotter, et. al., Accelerated precipitation in the AFA stainless steel Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al via cold working, Intermetallics, 53 (2014) 120-128.
3.1 Introduction
In order for an AFA to be a viable alternative, in energy applications, it must have a strength and creep resistance that are close to or exceed those of Ni-based alloys.  AFAs have relied on MC carbides for strength [1, 3, 4, 15], but at temperatures greater than 800C there is concern that the carbides formed could coarsen and dissolve [4].  
Further refinement of the Fe2Nb Laves phase particles has potential to improve the creep life and high temperature strength of AFAs.  Fe2Nb Laves phase particles have shown long-term stability at high temperatures [9, 15, 37, 44].  However, previous studies that looked to Laves phase particles for strength have only seen low or moderate creep resistance [9, 15].   Decreasing the precipitate size and increasing the volume fraction would enable the precipitates to effectively pin dislocations and extend creep life.  A Laves phase dispersion with particles less than 100 nm in diameter is recommended to obtain creep-levels on-par with MC carbide strengthened austenitic stainless steels [9]. 
One pathway to reducing the size and increasing the volume fraction of Laves phase precipitates in the matrix is to nucleate precipitates on dislocations.  Nucleation on dislocations is an effect first modeled by Cahn [46] in 1957 and occurs because it lowers the total strain energy of an embryo.  In order to effectively reduce the interfacial energy, precipitates that nucleate on dislocations should be well-matched on at least one matrix plane so they are able to form low-energy coherent or semi-coherent interfaces [51].  Images of Fe2Nb that has precipitated in austenite alloys that have the base components of AFAs (Fe-20Cr-35Ni-2Nb and Fe-20Cr-25Ni-2Nb) [37] show strain contrast in TEM images that is indicative of a semi-coherent precipitate-matrix interface, making Fe2Nb a promising candidate for precipitation on dislocations in AFA-type alloys.
	Prestraining via cold work introduces dislocations that could dramatically affect the precipitation of the Laves phase, similar to what has been observed in previous studies of other precipitate systems [26-28, 38].  The effectiveness of prestraining before aging in changing microstructure and improving material properties depends on characteristics of the particular alloy system analyzed and the synergy of a number of different variables including, but not limited to: aging temperature, the amount of prestrain, and competing precipitation phenomena.  For example, the improved hardness observed in a copper-bearing steel that had been pre-strained prior to aging at 300°C was attributed to additional particle nucleation on dislocations or excess vacancies arising from prestraining, however at an aging temperature of 500°C the prestrain had little effect on hardness or particle nucleation [26].  In aluminum alloys cold work has been shown to have different effects in particular alloy systems, with dislocations enhancing hardening by providing nucleation sites for precipitates in the Al-Cu, Al-Cu-Mg, and Al-Cu-Li systems, while not proving effective for producing hardening in other aluminum systems [70]. Severe plastic deformation by cold rolling at room temperature followed by subsequent aging has been shown to improve both strength and ductility in a high strength Al-Mg-Si alloy [28] as well as a Cu-Ag alloy [27].  An increase in precipitation after cold work has been observed with other precipitates in alloys more closely related to AFAs.  HTUPS (high-temperature ultrafine-precipitation-strengthened steel) alloys, modified for Al2O3 formation, are cold worked to enhance the precipitation of nanoscale MC carbide precipitates during creep [1, 15, 25].  While aging studies on AFA-type alloys have been done in the past [44], Laves phase precipitates have yet to be targeted via a combined aging and cold working approach. 
In this study, the effect of cold work on a solution-annealed AFA-type alloy, Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) was investigated by comparing samples that had received cold work prior to aging to those that were simply aged. Microstructural analysis was performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).  In addition, the effect of cold work and aging on the hardness of the material was examined. 

3.2 Experimental
The as-cast material was homogenized in vacuum for 24 h at 1250°C, then water-quenched.  This solutionizing treatment was used since SEM investigations confirmed that it enabled the formation of a solutionized single phase matrix. Unrolled, 50% rolled, and 90% rolled samples were aged in air for 24 h and 240 h at 700°C, and for 2.4, 24, and 240 h at 800°C.  Microstructures were observed using a FEI XL30 field emission gun (FEG) SEM operated at 15 kV and a FEI Tecnai F20ST FEG operated at 200 kV, both equipped with EDS.
3.3 Results 
Figure 3.1Figure 1 shows bright-field TEM images with accompanying selected area diffraction (SAD) patterns of precipitates observed in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at.%).  After the solution treatment the average grain size was 865 µm.  Figure 3.1Figures 1a and 1b show microstructural features after the alloy was aged at 800°C for 24 hours and Figure 3.1Figure 1c shows the alloy after 50% cold work prior to aging at 240 h.  TEM examination confirmed that the alloy had an f.c.c. austenitic (γ) matrix (Figure 3.1a) and that the lighter precipitates observed in the SEM backscattered electron (BSE) images (see later) are C14-type Fe2Nb phase (Figure 3.1b) and that the darker precipitates are B2-ordered NiAl (Figure 3.1c).  The presence of both Laves phase and NiAl precipitates is in agreement with previous TEM analysis on precipitates in this alloy [9] and is typical of AFA-type alloys [1-7, 17, 21].

After sufficient aging and/or prior cold work Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates often appear interconnected.  For example, Figure 3.2 shows a dark field STEM image and EDS elemental maps of a specimen reduced by 50% and then aged for 240 h at 800°C.  The EDS maps and spectral data of Laves and B2-precipitates reveal that while the nickel makes up a large component of the matrix, it couples with the aluminum and is concentrated in the NiAl particles.  Compared to the B2 precipitate, the Nb-rich Laves phase precipitate has a lower aluminum (1.5 at. % vs. 20.7 at. %) and nickel (18 at. % vs. 43.6 at. %) content, and a higher iron (40 at. % vs. 25.1 at. %), chromium (15.0 at. % vs. 10.2 at. %) and aluminum (25.5 at. % vs. 0.4 at. %) content.  The EDS maps also reveal that while often co-located after cold work, the NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitates are distinct.

TEM investigation of specimens after 90% cold work followed by aging at 700°C show the presence of fine γ’-Ni3Al (L12) precipitates (Figure 3.3).  These precipitates have been observed in creep rupture samples of this alloy at 750°C 100 MPa and were noted to improve creep resistance [9].

Microstructural changes are shown as a function of rolling reduction and annealing time after aging at 700°C in  Figure 3.4Figure 4.  When the Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) alloy is as-aged at 700°C without prior cold work, no Laves phase precipitates were visible in the BSE images of the matrix up to 240 h (Figure 3.4 a,d).   With cold work prior to aging at 700°C both the B2 and Laves phase particles are globular in shape and are almost always coupled together in the matrix (Figure 3.4 b, c, e, f).  Specimens with 50% (Figure 3.4Figure 4b) and 90% (Figure 3.4c) cold work prior to aging for 24 h at 700°C had a non-uniform, but fine distribution of Laves phase particles with slightly larger B2 particles in the matrix.  A similar pattern of increased precipitation after cold work was observed after a 240 h anneal at 700°C (Figure 3.4d-f).

Figure 3.5 shows the microstructural evolution of the alloy at 800°C as a function of rolling reduction and annealing time.  At 800°C the microstructural response to aging and cold work was markedly different to that at 700°C.  NiAl and Laves phases precipitated at 800°C, but Ni3Al particles were not stable at this temperature.  Unlike at 700°C, at 800°C with no cold work, precipitates are visible both in the matrix and on the grain boundaries after 2.4 h (Figure 3.5a).  The Laves phase precipitates are elongated.  Precipitates on the grain boundary are larger than those in the matrix and there are no NiAl precipitates visible in the matrix, but they are present on the grain boundary. After 24 h there is a significant increase in the size of the Laves phase precipitates in the matrix and some are coupled with the B2-ordered NiAl precipitates (Figure 3.5d).  The Laves phase precipitates are needle-like and have several preferred orientations in the matrix.  After 240 h more NiAl particles are present.  From Figure 3.5g they do not appear to be homogeneously distributed in the matrix, but are co-located with Laves phase precipitates similar to the observations at 700°C.

Faster precipitation kinetics after cold work were also observed at 800°C as compared to 700°C when holding the aging time constant at 2.4 h (Figure 3.5a-c), 24 h (Figure 3.5Figure 5d-f), and 240 h (Figure 3.5f-i).  After 50% cold work Laves phase precipitates are present in the matrix and on the grain boundary (Figure 3.5 b, e, h), displaying a preferred orientation relationship with the matrix as observed in the as-aged case.  With 90% cold work (Figure 3.5 c, f, i) the microstructure more closely resembles that of the alloy with cold work at 700°C.  The Laves phase no longer appears elongated, but is globular in shape without any obvious preferred growth direction.  Also, in the samples aged at 800°C after 90% cold work on increasing the annealing time from 24 h to 240 h (Figure 3.5 f, i) it appears there is growth of both the Laves phase and B2 decorated subgrain boundaries.  While Laves phase precipitation was the main target of this study, samples with 90% cold work highlight once again how cold work influenced the precipitation process so that Laves was concurrent with NiAl precipitation.  For example, whereas it was noted that an aging treatment of 2.4 h at 800°C (Figure 3.5a) did not show significant NiAl precipitation, the same heat treatment after a 90% rolling reduction showed the matrix inundated with both NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitates (Figure 3.5c).  Without cold work, the B2 NiAl precipitates were rarely observed in the matrix except for after long aging times (Figure 3.5g).

￼
Figure 3.6: Hardness values for samples annealed at (a) 700ºC and (b) 800°C with error bars showing standard deviation of measurements.

In Figure 3.6a the Vickers microhardness of the solutionized alloy at 700°C (~160 HV) increased with subsequent aging for 24 h and 240 h (~300 and ~367 HV respectively).  50 and 90% reductions prior to aging improved the hardness at each aging time by at least 90 HV compared to the as-aged state.  Within the 240 h aging period, the alloy only shows a hardness peak ( ~495 HV) after a 90% rolling reduction prior to aging for 24 h.  Subsequent aging to 240 h saw a slight decrease to ~471 HV. In a similar manner to the 700ºC aged samples, aging at 800ºC led to increased hardness after 50% and 90% rolling reductions prior to aging compared to the as-aged material at each time interval (Figure 3.6b).  However, for each reduction condition, there was an initial increase in hardness after 2.4 h and a subsequent decrease in hardness with further aging at 800°C.  For example, samples without cold work and those with reductions of 0%, 50%, and 90% saw hardness drop between aging at 2.4 h and 24 h.  


3.4 Discussion
The above results show that cold rolling after solutionizing, but prior to aging, produces both more rapid precipitation of the Laves phase in the matrix and causes matrix precipitation of NiAl at 700°C and 800°C and of Ni3Al at 700°C.   With aging, the Laves precipitates show a trend of initially fast growth followed by subsequent slower coarsening as observed in a 9CrW steel [71]. As observed in the work of Yamamoto et al. after creep-rupture of this alloy at 750°C [9], when this alloy is simply aged at 800°C the Laves phase is also plate-like in shape.  Samples that were simply aged without prior cold work show precipitation trends similar to those observed by Takeyama [37] of the precipitation of Laves phase on the grain boundary and within the grain for the alloy Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb after aging.  The generated Time-Temperature-Precipitation (TTP) diagram showed that after aging for 1200 hours at 800°C Laves phase particles also precipitated homogeneously in the matrix with grain boundary precipitates being larger than those in the matrix. After 24 hours at 800°C the coarsening of the C14-type phase was mostly complete, except for where the C-14-type phase was coupled with the NiAl-type B2 phase. The Fe2Nb and the NiAl phase has also shown thermal stability after 2160 h at 800°C in an Fe-20Cr-15Ni-5Al-base alloy [15] and at 2012 h in other AFA alloys [44].  The Laves phase precipitates consistently grew along only a few directions within a given grain.

Image analysis of particle size at 700°C (Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.8) and 800°C (Figure 3.9 Figures 9 and Figure 3.1010) provides insight into how aging and cold work impacted NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitate growth.  A lognormal distribution shows the best fit for most of the sample data.  At 700°C cold work induced precipitate formation of the Laves (Figure 3.7) and B2-NiAl (Figure 3.8).  These precipitates saw modest increases in size when aging from 24 to 240 hours.  This early precipitate formation would not have occurred with aging alone except at higher temperatures.  This is an effect that has been seen in alpha-iron, where cold work samples caused precipitation to occur at a much lower temperature (250°C) than in samples that had simply been aged (525°C) and was also attributed to lattice defects increasing the diffusion of the precipitate-forming element [72].   At 800°C with 0, 50% and 90% cold work both Laves and B2-NiAl precipitate sizes more than doubled when aging from 2.4 to 240 hours (Figure 3.9 and Figure 3.10).  The same was true for the NiAl except for the case of 90% cold work where the average particle size was relatively stable in going from 24 to 240 hours.  50% cold work did not increase the volume fraction of precipitates compared to the as-annealed state, while 90% cold work led to a larger volume fraction of precipitates.  In all cases, the standard deviation of the particle sizes increased with aging.   TEM images of samples aged at the shorter 2.4 h interval showed very few particles existed below the data collection range used in the SEM so volume fraction results are expected not to be significantly impacted by SEM resolution limits.

	A refined matrix that had reduced precipitate size and increased volume fraction was the desired microstructure for improved creep strength.  In all cases up to 240 h at 700°C Laves and NiAl particles did not show large increases in size and were ~30-70 nm above the upper 100 nm size limit (Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.8).  At 800°C while Laves particles initially started out in the 100 nm range, they grew to over 250 nm after aging for 240 h (Figure 3.9). NiAl particle size increased to over 300 nm with just aging and with 50% cold work.  Particle size did not increase as rapidly in going from 24h (181nm) to 240h (188 nm) after 90% cold work (Figure 3.10).   Even though particles over 100 nm were observed after 240 h, cold working the material did lead to a higher volume fraction of precipitates. Despite particle growth at 700°C and 800°C, for each aging condition samples with 90% cold work had the highest total volume fraction of Laves and NiAl precipitates (Table 3.1). 

Table 3.1: Volume fraction and standard deviations for NiAl and Laves phase particles.
￼

The faster precipitation kinetics observed in the austenitic alloy Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al after cold work is not unusual.  For example, in as-cast FeNiMnAl alloys, β-Mn-structured particles only precipitate out after long anneals, but the high dislocation densities and large concentrations of vacancies in samples that have been mechanically milled accelerates their nucleation significantly [73].  Similarly, in 316 austenitic stainless steels, it was speculated that an acceleration of intermetallic precipitation could occur due to the speeding up of substitutional diffusion via an increased defect concentration.  Laves-phase precipitation was accelerated after cold work and it was hypothesized that it was the result of increased diffusivity of elements that made up the Laves phase [38].  Takeyama’s analysis indicated that in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb the formation of the Laves phase was controlled by Nb diffusion in the austenite [37] and it follows in this case that the introduction of cold work into the alloy increased the diffusivity of the Laves phase forming elements in the austenitic matrix.  In general, the distribution of the particles after cold work was non-uniform.  At both 700 and 800°C the alloy microstructure after cold work is not as homogeneous as for alloys that had simply been aged due to the presence of features such as deformation bands, cellular networks etc..  The precipitation structure would most likely have been more uniform after deformation had particles been present during the rolling reduction, but since the starting point was a fully-solutionized matrix, their distribution was affected by the dislocation structures that were introduced by cold work [74].  
	Both the Laves and NiAl phases are no longer elongated and are instead globular after 90% cold work followed by aging at 800°C.   The globular precipitates observed after 50% cold work at 700°C and 90% cold work at 800°C appeared to have no preferred crystallographic orientation.  A number of factors could have influenced this change in morphology.  Their shape may have been influenced by their general appearance on grain boundaries and densely packed dislocations.  Their concurrent precipitation also may have affected growth.  When Takeyama compared Fe-20Cr-35Ni-2Nb to Fe-20Cr-25Ni-2Nb the Laves phase morphology was shown to change with the c/a ratio.  It was also demonstrated that the alloy with decreased nickel content contained a Laves phase that was smaller and less elongated [37].  
The hardness for the alloy aged at 700ºC is reflective of changes brought about by aging and cold work (Figure 3.6aFigure 6a).  As Laves and NiAl particles form their constituent atoms contribute less to solution strengthening and more to precipitate strengthening. At 700°C after 50% cold work, hardness increases in conjunction with an increase in the volume fraction of both NiAl and Fe2Nb precipitates.  With 90% cold work there is increased hardness as compared to 50% cold worked samples with a peak in hardness at 24 hours, the decrease at 240 hours is most likely influenced by particle growth.  The presence of the Ni3Al particles most likely contributes to the higher hardness values seen at 700°C compared with those seen at 800°C.  At 800°C a hardness peak is not only observed after a 90% reduction, but also with a 50% reduction and by simply aging.  The higher temperature is most likely the reason behind the increased aging rate due to the aforementioned enhanced diffusion through the matrix.  At 800°C with no cold work the single hardness peak is consistent with simple nucleation and precipitate growth.  With the rise in the volume fraction of NiAl (0.3% to 2.6%) the NiAl precipitates increase by nearly a third in size (194 vs. 322 nm), which may be the cause of the decrease in hardness (Figure 3.6b).   With 90% cold work, after aging at 800ºC for 24 h a large hardness decrease is congruent with the growth of recrystallized grains (Figure 3.5c).  After 240 h (244 Hv), the recrystallization that has occurred at 800ºC results in a hardness similar to the 240 h as-aged condition (242 HV).   




3.5 Summary
Cold work resulted in the creation of a defect structure that facilitated the heterogeneous precipitation of both C14-type Fe2Nb and B2-type NiAl precipitates.   Increasing the amount of cold work caused the B2 phase to precipitate out after shorter anneals and at a lower temperature.  Both B2 and Laves phases experienced more rapid precipitation in the matrix compared to material that had not been strained prior to aging at 700ºC and 800ºC.  γ’-Ni3Al precipitates were also noted after a 90% rolling reduction prior to aging at 700ºC.   Rolling reductions of 50 and 90% followed by ageing at 700°C and a 90% rolling reduction followed by ageing at 800°C was shown to be effective in accelerating precipitation and refining the precipitates in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al.  At 700°C, cold work was effective in increasing precipitate volume fraction at each aging condition when compared to samples that were simply aged.  The change in the kinetics occurring at the higher temperature of 800°C influenced the effects of aging and cold work.  For example, hardness peaks were observed with and without cold work.  Precipitate size also generally increased.  In the case of 90% cold work, the number density of precipitates only decreases with time even though the combined precipitate number density peaked and more than tripled within a short time period as compared to simply aged samples.  Even when taking coarsening into consideration, with 90% cold work, the combined NiAl and Laves phase volume fraction increased.  The increased precipitation caused by sufficient levels of cold work resulted in increased hardness when compared to material that had been simply aged.

This chapter is largely derived from: G. Trotter, et. al., The effect of aging on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of the alumina-forming austenitic stainless steel Fe–20Cr–30Ni–2Nb–5Al, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 627 (2015) 270-276.
4.1 Introduction
The materials needed for energy applications have traditionally been those that maximize efficiency and decrease costs.  Alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels have shown promise to decrease reliance on expensive Ni-base alloys for aggressive conditions in energy production and chemical processing environments [17].  AFAs use alumina as a protective oxide scale for high corrosion resistance instead of chromia; alumina is known to offer even better protection than chromia at high temperatures [18, 19].  
The newer grades of AFA stainless steels have an austenitic matrix, which provides better high-temperature creep strength than a b.c.c. matrix, and either MC or γ’-Ni3Al precipitates provide creep strengthening [9, 10, 17].  AFA stainless steels, which exist over a wide compositional range, have shown promising results but further study is needed to find the optimum combination of alloying elements that provide the most effective creep strengtheners at reasonable cost for commercialization [17]. Even within particular grades of AFAs, the influence of precipitate phases on creep strength is complex and a wide variety of creep strengths can be obtained with relatively small changes in alloying elements and phases [17, 21, 24] .
Laves phase precipitates are potential candidates for strengthening AFA stainless steels.  The AB2-type Laves phase generally comes in one of three forms: hexagonal MgZn2 (C14), cubic MgCu2 (C15) or hexagonal MgNi2 (C36) [29].  Even though Laves phase has been shown to be harmful in some ferritic steels [34], decreasing their toughness and strength and  precipitating at the grain boundaries, some research has indicated their potential for strengthening in both AFA stainless steels and alloys with similar compositions [9, 15, 22-24, 35].  Use of the C14 Fe2Nb  as a strengthener in an AFA steel could be advantageous because it has a high melting temperature of 1641°C, exists in equilibrium with f.c.c. γ-Fe to temperatures above 955°C [35, 37], and has shown long-term stability at high temperatures [9, 15, 37, 44].  Some previous studies have looked to Laves phase particles for strengthening in AFA-type alloys, but have only seen low or moderate improvements in creep resistance [9, 15].  There was a slight improvement in creep resistance at 750°C and 100 MPa in an AFA steel when the niobium content increased from 1-2 at. % but the improvement was small when compared to the effect of increased carbon content.  There was some dislocation pinning by coarse 500 nm size Fe2Nb precipitates and 10 nm size MC carbide precipitates but it was not clear whether the combination of precipitates was better than strengthening by MC carbide alone [15].  
In the present work, the effects of heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of an alumina-forming austenitic stainless steel, Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at.%) have been investigated. We show that, despite extensive intermetallic coverage of the grain boundaries, surprisingly, the material was able to show both good ductility and strength. 

4.2 Experimental
A 1250 ºC solution treatment of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) was used to produces a single phase material.  Samples were subsequently aged in air for 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h, 480 h and 1325 h at 800°C.  A FEI XL-30 field emission gun (FEG) scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated at 15 kV and equipped with EDS was used for microstructural analysis.  Samples were prepared for SEM analysis by polishing with successively finer grits of silicon carbide paper, up to 1200 and with 0.3 and 0.05 µm alumina powder in a water to obtain a mirror finish.  Backscattered electron (BSE) images from the specimens were processed using ImageJ using the routine described in the Experimental section of this thesis using Z-contrast to distinguish precipitates.

4.3 Results and Discussion
After solutionizing at 1250°C the alloy is single phase austenite (f.c.c.) and after aging at 800°C both Laves and NiAl phases are present [75].  Figure 4.1 shows XRD patterns of the evolution of C14-type Fe2Nb and B2-ordered NiAl precipitates in the austenitic matrix after a 1250°C, 24 h solution heat treatment and subsequent aging at 800°C for 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h, and 1325 h.  X-ray peaks corresponding to C14 and B2 phases were not clearly visible until 24 and 240 h, respectively.

Figure 4.2 shows BSE images of the microstructures after the 1250°C solution heat treatment and after aging at 800°C for  0.5 h, 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h, and 1325 h;; the phase showing the light contrast is the C-14 type Fe2Nb and the darker phase is the B2-structured NiAl.  These precipitates are common in AFAs [1-7, 17, 21, 76].  Figure 4.2 (b) shows that precipitation of the Laves phase occurs on the grain boundaries even within 30 minutes at 800°C.  Figure 4.2 (c) shows that after aging for 2.4 h at 800ºC NiAl precipitation accompanies the Laves phase precipitation on the grain boundaries, however, the Laves phase precipitates make up a majority of the grain boundary precipitates and are coarser than the Laves phase precipitates in the grain interior. After aging for 24 h (Figure 4.2 (d)) the Laves and NiAl precipitates have increased in size in the matrix and the NiAl grain boundaries and the amount of NiAl on the grain boundaries is now similar to the extent of Laves phase coverage. Figure 4.2 (e) shows that at 240 h the NiAl precipitates have significantly increased in size in the matrix compared to the Laves phase, but on the grain boundaries the Laves and NiAl particles are comparable in size.  After aging for 1325 h (Figure 4.2 (e)) larger Laves phase particles are present in the matrix, and the size of the NiAl particles has also increased.  As the aging time increased, a precipitation free zone (PFZ) becomes evident on the grain boundaries and increases in size.  The formation of the precipitate free zone with longer aging is not surprising since the grain boundaries and matrix precipitates are made up of the same solute atoms [77].  In a 60 µm grain sized sample of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) that was examined after creep-rupture testing at 750ºC and 100 MPa, a γ’-PFZ was formed that was postulated to have caused low creep-ductility.  It was suggested that coarsening the grain size or using directional solidification to reduce the total grain boundary area might improve creep properties [9].

￼

Table 4.1 shows the average Laves and NiAl particle sizes both on the grain boundaries and within the matrix at each aging condition.  The sizes of NiAl and Laves phase matrix precipitates for aging up to 240 h were reported in [75] and are duplicated in the table.  The Laves phase particles in the matrix after 24 h nearly doubled in size (205 nm) compared to the size at 2.4 h (95 nm).  The Laves phase precipitates on the grain boundaries are 192 nm after aging for 2.4 h and show continued growth up to 743 nm after 1325 h.  The NiAl particles are not visible in the matrix after 2.4 hours, but appear on the grain boundaries (126 nm) and are slightly smaller than the Laves phase grain boundary precipitates (192 nm).  Once NiAl precipitation is observed in the matrix at 24 h, the particle size continues to increase for aging times up to 1325 h: at 240 h the NiAl particle size (323 nm) is larger than that of the Laves phase (252 nm).  At 240 h the grain boundary NiAl particles (366 nm) are also larger than the Laves phase particles on the grain boundaries (252 nm) and they continue to grow at a faster rate than the Laves phase grain boundary particles for aging up to 1325 h.  After 1325 h the Laves phase particles showed growth to 301 nm in the matrix and the NiAl matrix particles had increased to 734 nm.  In a Fe-20Cr-15Ni-5Al (at. %) base alloy [15] the authors noted that after 2160 h at 800°C there was not much change in the microstructure indicating good thermal stability. This thermal stability has also been noted after 2012 h at 750°C in other AFA alloys [44].

Table 4.2 shows how the area fraction of grain boundary precipitates changes with time.  While there is no grain boundary coverage without aging, after 2.4 hours there is 56% grain boundary coverage.  There is much more variability in grain boundary coverage after aging at 2.4 h.  There is significant grain boundary coverage of 78% after 24 h and 84% after 240 h.  After 1325 h the grain boundary was almost completely saturated with 93% coverage. At the early stages of aging, the amount of grain boundary precipitation significantly varies depending on the grain boundary misorientation.  This is consistent with Denham and Silcock’s observation that the size and density of the Fe2Nb precipitates can show variations based on the crystallography of the grain boundary [78].  In the present alloy, as the grain boundary precipitates grew in size as the sample was aged, the boundaries that had less coverage initially were able to ‘catch up’ which led to  increased grain boundary coverage as the sample was aged.  

Figure 4.3 (a) is a bright- field TEM image showing dislocations surrounding the Laves phase precipitates.  Dislocations can be punched out due to the strains arising from the difference in the thermal expansion between the precipitate and matrix.  The dislocations formed from the precipitation of the Laves phase then act as sites for further Laves phase precipitation and can result in the formation of stringers [77]. Evidence of precipitation in this manner is visible in the BSE image shown in Figure 4.3 (b) where in one grain, there are lines of precipitates that have presumably precipitated on punched out dislocations. The strain contrast that is present in TEM images of Fe2Nb that has precipitated in austenite in Fe-20Cr-35Ni-2Nb and Fe-20Cr-25Ni-2Nb (at. %) after aging at 800°C [37] is indicative of a semi-coherent precipitate-matrix interface and may be a reason why the Laves phase has shown stability during aging and creep testing at 800 °C [47].  If the precipitate had a different crystal structure than the matrix it would be expected to form a needle-like or disk-like nucleus [51].

Tensile testing showed that the strength and ductility of the alloy was strongly influenced by the aging time and, hence, the formation and coarsening of the precipitates.  Increasing the aging time led to an increase in tensile strength, but a decrease in ductility, (Figure 4.4).

Figure 4.5 shows BSE images of the fracture surfaces after tensile testing, which all displayed dimple-type ductile rupture irrespective of the measured elongations.  The trends of decreased ductility and improved strength with ageing observed here have been noted in other AFA alloys aged at 750°C [44]. In AFA alloys with base composition Fe- (11.90-14.24)Cr -1.93Mn- (20.1025.24) Ni- (0.47-0.48) Cu- (2.87-3.91) Al- .14Si- (1.01-1.00)Nb- (2-2.01)Mo- (1-.99)W (wt. %) yield strength and ultimate tensile strength reached maximum values  (400-450 and 890-930 MPa respectively) after 50 or 500 h aging and the yield strength did not show much change, while the ultimate tensile strength slightly decreased.  Among the AFA alloys tested, elongation continuously decreased with aging regardless of composition [44].  In contrast to other heat treatment conditions, the tensile test curves after aging for 2.4 h were discontinuous and showed an upper and lower yield point with a L￼der’s strain of 5%.  This yield-point phenomenon has been studied extensively in steels and is known to occur when dislocations quickly multiply and the average dislocation velocity decreases along with the stress needed to move dislocations [79-81].  A summary of the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation for each aging condition is presented in Table 4.2.  When an upper and lower yield strength was observed, the lower yield strength is presented.

Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.7 show representative plots of the strain hardening exponent fit for the different aging conditions. The n value can range from 0 to 1 with typical values being from 0.1 to 0.6 [82].  In Figure 4.7 the double logarithmic plot of the true stress and true strain for the solutionized alloy did not show a good straight line fit, while linear fits with R2 values close to 1 were obtained for aging times of 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h and 1325 h (Figure 4.7), i.e. except for the as-solutionized alloy, all the other specimens could be well described by the Hollomon equation.  Hollomon noted that there were cases where the log-log plots of stress and strain can curve upward, especially for larger strains, suggesting anisotropy [66].  The homogenized, non-aged alloy showed the largest elongation. Figure 4.6 shows that this alloy displayed two-stage work hardening also known as ‘double n’ behavior.  The curve is deconvoluted to show two stages of work-hardening with the first curve showing a small n-value of 0.18 followed by a second stage showing a high n value of 0.70.  The representative log-log plots in Figure 4.7 for samples aged at 2.4 h, 24 h, 240 h and 1325 h show a good match to the Holloman equation all with R2 values of 0.99.  Samples aged at 2.4 h showed the highest work-hardening exponent with n = 0.62.  This is most likely due to the effects of discontinuous yielding. The n value for steels typically decreases with increasing strength.  The highest possible n value of a steel is when its strength is the lowest and n tends to increase with elongation [83].   In the present study, n-values after aging at 24 h, 240 h and 1325 h were ~0.3.   The strain hardening values are summarized in Table 4.2.   



￼

Figure 4.8:  Yield strength vs. inverse interparticle spacing for Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %).
Figure 4.8 shows a linear fit to a plot of the inverse mean surface-to-surface interparticle spacing versus the yield strength, which produces the equation σy (MPa) = 74-1 +202 where  is the mean interparticle spacing.  The predicted value of the yield strength from this equation without any particles at 202 MPa is closely similar to the experimentally-measured value of 205 MPa.  The result is indicative of a looping mechanism of particle strengthening.  An Orowan looping-based mechanism would make sense for the Laves phase precipitates because they are hard and brittle and would act as a barrier to dislocation motion [44].  The model does not, however, completely capture the results obtained.  The largest YS and UTS waswere observed after 1325 h, not after 24 h when the smallest interparticle spacing was observed. 
It is possible that the greater grain boundary coverage at 1325 h is what caused the alloy to show both higher yield and tensile strength even as the matrix particles coarsened and the interparticle distance increased.   Tarigan et al. reported that creep life was extended without ductility loss even with increased Laves phase grain boundary precipitation in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb (at. %) [22, 23] and called the strengthening mechanism a “grain boundary precipitation strengthening mechanism” (GBPS) which they proposed was caused by decreased grain boundary deformation in sections of the grain boundary covered by the Laves phase.  In Chen et al.’s study of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-0.03B (at. %) it was also concluded that precipitation of the Laves phase on the grain boundaries enhanced creep resistance [24]. These alloys did not include additions of Al so instead of just Laves phase, both Laves and NiAl precipitates are present on the matrix and grain boundary.  Consistent with the results involving creep, the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength maximum at 1325 h in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %)  reflects the condition of maximum grain boundary coverage, indicating that the increased grain boundary precipitation acted as a more effective barrier to dislocations.  After 24 h, when over 78% of the grain boundaries were covered with precipitates, in spite of a decreased interparticle distance, the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength showed a relatively small increase up to the 1325 h aging time, compared to the initial increase in strength from the precipitation observed at 2.4 h.  The 93% grain boundary coverage at 1325 h, coupled with the more than doubling and tripling of grain boundary precipitate size at 24 h for the Laves and NiAl, respectively led ductility to decrease by ~1/3.
 Even with the grain boundaries being nearly completely saturated with precipitates of brittle phases, the alloy had ductility of 19% after 1325 h.  If the two phases are relatively coherent with the grain boundary, it would be expected that a favorable combination of creep and ductility could be attained [84].  For example, data from Keown and Pickering’s on AISI type 347 stainless steels in 1974 [85] suggested that the Fe2Nb on grain boundaries might have improved creep ductility, but Kestenbach and Bueno [84] presented evidence that disproved this.  They also cited that Fe2Nb precipitation caused decreased ductility in the high temperature tensile tests performed by Denham and Silcock [78]. However, in Bei et al.’s more recent study of AFAs, even though the ductility decreased with aging, it was still 10-15% in room temperature tensile tests after aging for 2012 h, even though there was extensive grain boundary coverage of both NiAl and Laves phases [44].  Tarigan et al. [22, 23]  observed that even with 89% grain boundary coverage by the Laves phase precipitates a creep rupture strain of 77% was attained which suggests that Laves phase grain boundary precipitates do not necessarily lead to deleterious embrittlement. The most often cited Laves phase orientation relationship with austenite achieves a 5% contraction of the matrix in the [111] direction and 9% expansion in the [112] direction [78] which represents a moderate misfit when compared to high misfit particles such as niobium carbonitride (~23% mismatch with the austenite matrix [86]) which can reduce creep ductility.  In an Fe-Ni-Cr-Al (FNCA) alloy with a similar base composition to the alloy in the present study that did not include niobium, two variants of the Kurdjmov-Sachs relationship were found for NiAl [42].  If present in this alloy, this relationship might achieve a misfit with the matrix that would encourage ductility despite extensive grain boundary precipitation. If the more oft observed orientation relationships for NiAl and Laves phases are consistent for Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %), this may explain why the coverage of the grain boundaries with these brittle precipitates might lead to sufficient ductility. 

4.4 Summary
The microstructural and mechanical response to aging Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) at 800 °C after a 1250oC solution heat treatment was studied.  With aging the Laves phase particles at first grew rapidly in the matrix and after 24 h showed steady growth to 301 nm after 1325 h. The NiAl matrix particles after 24 h were only 90 nm at the 24 h time interval and grew relatively quickly up to 734 nm after 1325 h.  Both Laves and NiAl particles grew substantially on the grain boundaries and more than doubled in size as the sample was aged from 240 to 1325 h. 

Tensile tests were performed and the strain-hardening exponent generally showed a good fit to the Holloman equation. The unaged alloy showed two-stage work hardening.  When the alloy was aged at 2.4 h an upper and lower yield point was observed.  Improved strength was observed with increased grain boundary precipitation as the sample was aged, reaching a maximum of 383 MPa at 1325 h even though the interparticle spacing decreased.  
Even as the grain boundary precipitate coverage increased to 93% after 1325 h the alloy showed room temperature elongation of 19 %.  It was hypothesized that the ductility in the alloy may be related to the low-misfits of the precipitates with the austenite matrix.

This chapter is largely derived from: Geneva Trotter et. al., Orientation Relationships of Laves Phase and NiAl Particles in an AFA Stainless Steel., Philosophical Magazine, (2015) 1-17accepted October 2015.
5.1 Introduction
Within particular grades of alumina-forming-austenitic stainless steels (AFAs), the influence of precipitate phases on creep strength is complex.  A wide range of creep strengths can be obtained with relatively small changes in alloying elements.  Phases that are beneficial in some AFAs cause decreased creep strength in others.  The Laves phase, for example, having shown long-term stability at high temperatures [9, 15, 37, 44], has been investigated for its ability to act as a strengthener [9, 15, 24, 76, 87].  Along with the Laves phase, the role of B2-NiAl particles in AFAs has been investigated. B2-NiAl particles have been shown to act as strengtheners in room temperature tensile tests in AFA alloys, but have not shown any strengthening effect at 750°C due to the brittle-to-ductile transition common to B2 intermetallic compounds [44]. The B2 particles support the formation of the alumina layer in AFAs by acting as an Al reservoir [44, 88].  promise
The Laves phase has an AB2 stoichiometry and can exist as three closely-related structures C14, C15, and C36.  C15 (MgCu2, ￼ ) is the cubic form of the Laves phase, C14 is a hexagonal structure (MgZn2, P63/mmc), and C36 which is also hexagonal (MgNi2, P63/mmc).  Identification of the specific structure prevalent for an alloy system can vary with composition and heat treatment [89].  In some instances different structures are present in a given alloy [90] or one structure transforms into another [91-93].  Two crystal structures can often be present in a single particle [91, 94].  The C14-type Fe2Nb Laves phase that has been observed in studies of AFAs and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images typically has a plate-like morphology.  
The B2-NiAl phase has CsCl crystal structure, space group ￼.  B2 particles are spherical in some materials such as precipitation-hardenable martensitic stainless steels [40] and have also shown plate-like morphology in Fe-Ni-Cr-Al (FNCA) alloys [41, 42].   There are few observations of diffraction patterns with the Laves phase being compared along with its parent matrix.  While extensive work has been done recently by Bhowmik and co-workers [95-100] and Kumar and co-workers in the past [90, 91, 101-103] in understanding Cr2Ta Laves phase structures and polymorphs, observed in Cr-Ta alloys, the Fe2Nb Laves phase has received comparatively very little attention.  As noted in [89] there are not many clear diffraction patterns in the literature depicting the Laves phase in stainless steel.  In this study, both Laves phase and B2-NiAl particles were formed from aging a solutionized, single-phase f.c.c. matrix of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al, with the objective of determining the crystallographic relation between the f.c.c. matrix and the Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates via transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations. 
5.2 Experimental
      Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) was cast into 15.24 cm long, 2.54 cm diameter ingots by vacuum arc-melting followed by drop casting into a copper crucible, courtesy of Dr. Easo P. George.  After casting the alloy was homogenized for 24 h at 1250ºC.  The alloy was then aged at 800°C for up to 1325 h [18].  An FEI XL30 SEM operated at 15 kV was used to observe microstructural features. Samples for the SEM were ground using silicon carbide papers up to 1200 grit and polished to a mirror finish using 0.3 and 0.05 µm alumina powder in water.  Specimens for TEM observation were cut into rectangular bars that were milled into 3 mm diameter cylinders.  The cylinders were cut into 3 mm discs and polished to ~150 µm thick.  The thin foils were then twin jet electropolished in a solution of 25% nitric acid in methanol using a Struers Tenupol 5 at a voltage of 11 V and current of 100 mA at -20°C.  Microstructural examination of the specimens was performed using a Tecnai F20 FEG TEM operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 keV and equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).  
Experimental selected area diffraction patterns were simulated using CrystalMaker® 9.1.3 and SingleCrystal® 2.3.1 software.  The lattice parameters used to simulate SAD patterns for the matrix (a = 0.361 nm), Laves phase particles ( a = 0.482 nm, c = 0.784 nm), and NiAl particles ( a = 0.289 nm) were determined from X-ray diffraction from [18].  The value for the Laves phase is comparable to that obtained for (Fe, Cr, Ni)2(Nb, Si) Laves particles (a = 0.476 nm and c = 0.786 nm) in a Fe-15Cr-15Ni-Nb (wt.%) austenitic stainless steel that had additions of Si and other alloying elements [41]. Without 2 wt. % niobium the alloy had a matrix lattice parameter of a = 0.3549 nm, and with niobium the austenite lattice expanded to 0.3556 nm  [41].  A study of deformation behavior in an AFA steel used a similar lattice parameter of 0.361 nm for the f.c.c. matrix [20].  The Laves lattice parameter noted in this study also falls within the range found in a study of Fe-Ni-Nb, by Takeyama et. al [42] and Denham and Silcock [43].  The lattice parameter of stoichiometric B2-NiAl was reported to be 0.28864 nm [44] and the lattice parameters of Ni-(42-55)Al has been shown to fall in the range of 0.287-0.289 nm  [45].

5.3 Results and Discussion
5.3.1 Overview of Precipitates
Laves phase and B2-NiAl particles in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al typically appear to grow in distinct directions [9, 75, 87].  Figure 5.1 shows SEM backscattered electron (BSE) images of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al after both a solution treatment and a series of aging treatments at 800°C.  In Figure 5.1a the alloy shows no evidence of precipitation and is single-phase f.c.c. After aging at 800°C for 24 h Laves phase particles showing bright contrast have precipitated uniformly in the matrix with a few (dark) B2-NiAl particles present (Figure 5.1b).  Three lines are drawn on the image parallel to the long axis of the particles and a circle is drawn for the particles that appear to project out of the image.  The Laves phase particles appear to grow in only four directions.   In Figure 5.1c the BSE allows one to clearly see the larger, darker contrast B2-NiAl particles that are present at 240 h, which in some instances have grown to be much larger than the Laves phase precipitates.  In Figure 5.1d unlike at earlier times, after aging at 1325 h all NiAl particles that are visible in the matrix are much larger than the Laves phase particles in the matrix.  Four lines are drawn on the image parallel to the NiAl particles, suggesting there are at least four growth directions for the NiAl particles.

Figure 5.1: BSE images showing Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al matrix after (a) solution treatment, and after subsequent aging at 800°C for (b) 24 h lines superimposed along the long axis of the Laves phase particles and a circle representing particles that appear to project from the image; (c) 240 h; and (d) 1325 h with lines superimposed on the images are along the long axis of the NiAl particles.

TEM-EDS results from the particles and matrix are presented in Table 5.1. The average matrix composition after aging at 800°C for 1325 h has decreased amounts of Cr, Ni, and Nb, and increased amounts of Fe, and Al as compared to the nominal alloy composition.  The B2-NiAl particles primarily consist of Ni (49.9 at. %), Al (38.1 at. %) with substantial amounts of Fe (9.2 at. %).  The values obtained for the B2-NiAl ((Ni,Fe)Al) particles are consistent with the B2-NiAl particle composition observed in a martensitic precipitation hardenable steel where atom probe data also showed a lower Al content and an incorporation of Fe while the Ni content was at 50 at. %  [104].  The Fe2Nb ((Fe, Cr, Ni)2Nb) Laves phase particles consisted primarily of Fe (40.3 at. %), Cr (14.2 at. %), Ni (15.4 at. %) and Nb (28 at. %).  Similar compositions for Fe2Nb Laves particles were observed by the author [75] and in other works [35, 54, 105, 106]. For example in a study of the alloy Fe-15Nb-40Ni (at. %) the Laves phase had a composition of Fe-27 at. % Nb-33 at. % Ni [105] and a study of Fe-16.2Cr-14.3Ni-1.2Nb (at. %) [54] described (Fe, Ni, Cr)2(Nb, Si) particles with a composition of Fe-12.6Ni-11.3Cr-22.9Nb-6.8Si (at. %), indicating a consistency in how the ‘A’ and ‘B’ elements that contribute to the AB2 Laves phase are proportioned.

5.4 Laves phase crystal structure and orientation relationship
There are 6 fundamental four-layer stacking schemes that can be combined to form Laves phase as described by Komura [32] and 2 four-layer schemes make up the C14 structure.  The C14 phase has 12 atoms per unit cell.  The stacking of the C14 structure along the (0001) planes is similar to the …ABAB… stacking sequence observed in hcp structures [31].  There are a number of ways to describe the stacking sequence.  For example, as described by Komura [32], the 2 layers form in the close-packed direction and follow an …AB’AB’… pattern, described as: αAαcßBßc… where αAαc represents the “A” and ßBßc represents the “B’”[33].  Greek letters correspond to large atoms (Nb in Fe2Nb) and Roman letters correspond to smaller atoms (Fe). Figure 5.2a shows a C14 Laves projection onto a (0001) plane.  Depending on which atoms are chosen to occupy the corner sites of a unit cell, different descriptions of the stacking constructions can be used. For example, Chen et al. [107] describes the AB2 C14 structure with small “‘B”’ atoms making up the corners of the unit cell (Figure 5.2b) and consisting of two blocks, B1 and B1’ containing a series of primed and unprimed planes that are twin related Figure 5.2c.  Figure 5.2d shows the typical representation of a C14 unit cell.   Kumar and Hazzledine [90] have an alternate description of the C14 stacking sequence where large atoms occupy the corners of a unit cell (Figure 5.2e).  The Laves structure is described as a construction of XY’ quadruple layers which are made up of alternating triple and single layers (Figure 5.2f).  Each triple layer is ¼ of the thickness of the quadruple layer and contains 1 atom per unit cell layer.  The single layer contains 3 small atoms (Figure 5.2g).

The orientation relationship between the Laves phase particles and the matrix was investigated via tilting experiments in the TEM.  A bright-field image of a hexagonally-shaped Laves phase precipitate in the f.c.c. matrix is shown in Figure 5.3a. Figure 5.3b and Figure 5.3c show kikuchi patterns taken from the matrix and a Laves phase precipitate, respectively.  Figure 5.3d shows a selected area diffraction pattern (SADP) of the precipitate and matrix.  A schematic representation of the SADP with indexing is shown in Figure 5.3e.  The six-fold symmetry in Figure 5.3e is consistent with the basal plane of the Laves phase (hexagonal (C14), P63/mmc). The Laves phase precipitate was oriented along the [0001] direction while the matrix was at [111].  Based on the diffraction patterns, and simulated results, the orientation relationship between the Fe2Nb precipitate and the austenite matrix for this particle was confirmed to be:

(0001)Fe2Nb // (111)γ
￼Fe2Nb // ￼γ

This is the relationship observed by Denham and Silcock [48] for Laves phase precipitates in an f.c.c. alloy with Fe, Cr, Ni, Nb and other minor constituents, and also in a Fe-16.2Cr-14.3Ni-1.2Nb (at. %)  alloy with minor alloying additions [54].  The Laves phase precipitate has the close-packed basal (0001) planes parallel to the close-packed (111) matrix planes that exhibit three-fold symmetry and a hexagonal pattern.  While many particles were observed with the above orientation, a number of variants were observed, which was expected from the observation of particles SEM images (Figure 5.1).

In Figure 5.4a a TEM bright-field image of an elongated Laves particle is shown.

The matrix is viewed along the [112] zone axis and the Laves phase along the ￼This precipitate has the specific orientation of ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p.

The solid circles represent reflections from the matrix and the hexagons represent reflections from the Laves phase.
The bright- field image in Figure 5.5a shows Laves phase/matrix orientation variants.  The Laves phase particles labeled with a “1” and a “2” are analyzed.   Laves phase particles labeled with a “(1)” or a “(2)” have the same orientation relationships of particles “1” and “2” respectively. The SADP in Figure 5.5b is taken from precipitate “1” and the SADP in Figure 5.5c is taken from precipitate “2”.  In both SADPs the f.c.c. matrix is viewed along the [101] zone axis.  Figure 5.5d and Figure 5.5e shows a representation of the superimposed electron diffraction patterns from both the matrix and the two particles with both particles being viewed along their ￼ zone axis.  Tilting experiments and the correspondence between the image and the electron diffraction pattern of the particles, revealed that the particle whose SADP is shown in Figure 5.5b has an orientation of ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p and that shown in Figure 5.5c has an orientation of ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p. These particles grow along the matrix {111} planes (￼ in Figure 5.5d and ￼ in Figure 5.5e).   The Particle shown in Figure 5.5c has the same orientation relationship as the particle presented in Figure 5.4.  Both of these particles have similar morphologies and their long axis pointing along the same direction.

In Figure 5.6a fourth variant of the orientation relationship between the matrix and the Laves phase is observed.  Figure 5.6a shows a TEM bright-field image with an elongated Laves phase precipitate labeled “1”.  The particle labeled “(1)” was also found to have the same orientation as particle “1”.  This precipitate is at an angle to the two other elongated Laves phase precipitates observed in Figure 5.5.  Figure 5.6b shows a diffraction pattern taken from particle “1” along the matrix [011] zone with the Laves phase precipitate at the ￼ zone.  Figure 5.6c shows the orientation relationship ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p for particle “1” as determined through tilting experiments.  The particles were observed to grow along the matrix ￼ plane.

In total, there were four primary variants of the Denham and Silcock orientation relationship observed in this study:

 ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p,                                               (1)
 ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p,                                               (2)
 ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p,                                               (3)

Based on the observation that for any given particle, the Laves phase {0001} close-packed planes tend to align with the {111} close-packed planes of the matrix, it can be predicted that considering symmetry, the four {111} planes in the f.c.c. matrix, and the three &lt;110&gt; directions within each {111} plane, up to 12 variants of the Laves phase and matrix orientation relationship might be observed in TEM studies (Table 5.2).

Since for directions of type &lt;0001&gt; and &lt;hki0&gt; plane normal and directions have the same indices, only these directions are plotted on the stereograph.  {￼ and {￼} refer to prism planes of type I and type II, respectively [108].  Figure 5.7a-d shows the stereographic projections of the 4 variants described above with Laves phase (0001) traces.  The Laves phase {0001} traces overlap with the matrix {111} traces.  
￼
Figure 5.7.:  Superimposed stereographic projections of the four Laves and f.c.c. phase orientation variants observed in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al after aging for 1325 h at 800 ºC.  (a) ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p; (b) ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p; (c) ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p (d) ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p.

Particles with a hexagonal shape had the 1st orientation described above, while those that were more elongated and often plate-like and faceted are seen to grow along the other matrix {111} directions.  The calculated diffraction patterns of Figure 5.4c, Figure 5.5d and e, and Figure 5.6c, {0001} Laves and {111} matrix planes are in close proximity to one another, and taken alone, this would suggest that these planes are nearly parallel and that  &lt;111&gt; are preferred directions for precipitate growth.  This observed orientation, according to Denham and Silcock is thought to be governed by the Fe and Nb containing A-layer of the Fe2Nb (AB2) and the attainment of the same atomic site densities for the matrix and precipitate [48]. 
In their description of the Laves Fe2Nb structure, Fe atoms occupy the corner sites of the C14 unit cell.  The stacking sequence along the ‘c’ axis is described as ABAB (Figure 5.8a), and the A layer is a puckered layer that consists of Nb and Fe with the Nb atoms at ￼, while the B layer contains Fe atoms (Figure 5.8b) [48].  The first layer of atoms that make up the basal plane of the Laves phase is coherent with the (111) matrix plane (Figure 5.8c) which results in a favorably small mismatch in lattice spacing.  In their analysis Denham and Silcock note that if a different orientation relationship occurred where the B layer of iron atoms were coherent instead, the density of atomic sites in the expanded matrix lattice would be 33% greater than in the observed orientation, which leads to the conclusion that it is the density relationship as well as well as the niobium atoms’ role in nucleation at the reaction front that are the major factors that cause the orientation that is observed.   Following the analysis in [48], given the above orientation relationship the f.c.c. matrix contracts by 6% in  the &lt;111&gt; direction and expands by 9% in the &lt;112&gt; direction and the volume expansion on transformation from matrix to precipitate is 12 %.  As noted by [109] others have successfully concluded the preferred direction of precipitate growth following this methodology, but this is not always an accurate assumption.  As predicted by the author in [87] and much like in [48] the Laves phase in the orientation relationship that has been observed was determined to have only a moderate misfit with the austenite matrix.  This may help to explain why this alloy has been shown to have room temperature ductility despite the presence of these brittle precipitates.

5.5 NiAl and matrix orientation relationship
Figure 5.9a shows a bright-field TEM image of a B2-NiAl particle.  Figure 5.9b and Figure 5.9c show a SADP taken from the NiAl particle and matrix, respectively.  In Figure 5.9b the particle is tilted to [011] and the matrix in coincident [111] in Figure 5.9c.  Figure 5.9d is a schematic of a superimposed diffraction pattern of both the particle and matrix.  From the diffraction pattern the particle was concluded to have a ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p orientation relationship, which is consistent with the Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship.

Figure 5.10 shows bright-field TEM images of additional B2-NiAl particles exhibiting different Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation variants determined via tilting experiments in the TEM.  In Figure 5.10a one additional NiAl particle Kurdjumov-Sachs variant is observed (to the right of the particle from Figure 5.9).  It was determined to have the orientation relationship ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p.  In Figure 5.10b two B2-NiAl particles and shown with ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p, and ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p variants of the Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship.

￼

Unlike with the Laves phase, NiAl particles that appeared to be oriented similarly in bright-field TEM images were observed to occasionally represent different variants of the K-S relationship.  For example, Figure 5.11 shows an analysis of two nearly side-by-side B2-NiAl particles in the matrix.  Figure 5.11a is a bright-field TEM image of the two particles in the matrix. Figure 5.11b shows a diffraction from the matrix down the [323] zone axis.  Figure 5.11c and Figure 5.11d show the diffraction patterns from the two NiAl particles while the matrix is at the [323] axis.  Figure 5.11e and Figure 5.11f show the simulated diffraction patterns of the two particles.  Though the particles appear to be oriented in the same direction based on the TEM bright- field image, their respective diffraction patterns reveal that they are two distinct twin-related variants of the K-S relationship having orientations of ￼m // ￼p￼m // ￼p, and ￼m // ￼p,  ￼m // ￼p, respectively.

In studies of the morphology and crystallography of martensite in steels a total of 24 (V1-V24) possible variants have been predicted for the K-S relationship [110-112].  Figure 5.12 shows the superimposed stereographic projections of the matrix and B2-NiAl particles that have the K-S relationship.  {111} and {011} matrix and precipitate planes are plotted on the stereographic projections.

In this study a total of 6 of the 24 K-S variants were observed:

Others have noted K-S variants and theory suggests that the lattice parameter value plays an important role in the determination of the preferred orientation observed in f.c.c./b.c.c. systems.  The K-S orientation relationship has been seen in an Fe-Ni-Cr-Al (FNCA) alloy [41, 42] with B2-NiAl precipitates that also had a plate-like morphology.  In that case, two K-S orientation relationship variants were observed.  In a study of f.c.c. Co precipitates in a B2-ordered (Ni,Co)Al alloy [58], 3 variants of the K-S orientation relationship were observed and it was noted that the ratio of the lattice parameters of the f.c.c and b.c.c. phase can influence the orientation relationship.  In [109] it was predicted that b.c.c. and f.c.c. systems have a lattice parameter ratio between 1.21 and 1.36 would have the K-S relationship.  Given the value of 1.25 for the lattice parameter ratio between the f.c.c. matrix and the B2-NiAl in this alloy, it is not surprising that K-S orientation is observed for the NiAl precipitates. 

Conclusions
Hexagonal-shaped and elongated Fe2Nb-type Laves phase, and plate-like B2-NiAl precipitates were observed after a solution anneal at 1250°C followed by aging at 800 °C in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al.  The orientation between the f.c.c. matrix and Laves phase was determined to have the ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p orientation relationship proposed by Denham and Silcock. The B2-NiAl precipitates were determined to have a Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship with the matrix, i.e. ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p.  While the Laves phase particles primarily followed four variants, six variants of the K-S orientation were observed for the B2-NiAl particles. 
















Chapter 6  Orientation Relationships of Laves Phase and NiAl Particles in an AFA Stainless SteelEffect of Aging on the Microstructural Evolution of DAFA26

7.1 Introduction
Recently, there has been a shift in focus on the development of AFAs.  AFAs have traditionally been strengthened by MC and/or M23C6 carbides [17], for example .  Ccreep resistance in an AFA was shown to improve with an increase in nanoscale MC precipitates [7, 10].  New studies of AFAs have shown that nano-scale γ’ –Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates can be used to improve creep [21].  Earlier studies of AFAs have noted the presence of L12 precipitates [17, 75], and nNew studies of AFAs have shown that nano-scale γ’ –Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates can be used to improve creep [21].  .  The present study uses SEM, XRD, TEM, and atom probe tomography (APT) to investigate the microstructural evolution of precipitates while aging in DAFA26 (also known as ‘32Z’ based on a Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-0.15Si-(3-4)Al-(1-3)Ti-(0-0.3)Zr wt. % alloy with or without C and B, where the ‘32’ refers to 3#Al-21Ti with Zr addition) [21].
7.2 Experimental
Samples of DAFA26 were obtained from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  600 g ingots were arc-melted using pure element feedstock.  The arc-melted ingots were then drop cast into a 1” x 1” x 3” bar shape die, soaked for 2 hours at 1100°C in Ar + 4% H2 gas and then hot-rolled along the longitudinal axis with an approximately 15-20% thickness reduction per pass until the desired thickness reduction (up to 80%) was achieved.  The same homogenization temperature of 1100°C was then used to solutionize the plate for 30 minutes in Ar + 4% H2 gas, followed by air cooling.  Table 6.1 includes both the nominal composition and analyzed composition of DAFA26.

 Table 0.1: DAFA26 alloy composition (nominal and analyzed)
￼
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on DAFA26 samples and MDI Jade software was used to identify phases in the alloys and to analyze the diffraction patterns.
Vickers hardness of DAFA26 after different heat treatments was determined using a TIME TH-713 Microhardness Tester under a load of 1.96 N (200 g) with a 15 second dwell time.  
TEM, SEM, and APT analysis of the DAFA26 was also performed.  TEM thin-foils were observed in an EDS-equipped FEI Tecnai FS20ST FEG TEM operated at 200 kV.  The resulting TEM samples were also observed in a FEI XL30 filed emission gun (FEG) scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated at 15 kV.  Atom probe tomography (APT) analysis was performed at Oak Ridge National Lab using a Cameca instruments local electrode atom probe (LEAP).  Specimens were annularly milled in an FEI Nova 200 dual beam FIB-SEM after being electropolished in a solution of 2% perchorlic acid and 98% 2-butoxyethanol.  Some samples were also fabricated by annular milling and a lift-out procedure [63].  



7.3 Results and Discussion
Figure 6.1 shows XRD patterns of the DAFA26 in the as-hot-rolled state and after 2, 72, 720, and 3000 h of aging at 750°C with f.c.c., B2, L12, and Laves phase peaks labeled.  The diffraction patterns for each condition are nearly identical.  F.c.c. and C14 Laves phase peaks are of similar intensities throughout the aging sequence, while the L12 and B2 peaks become more prominent as the aging time increases.  Whole pattern fitting of the diffraction pattern yielded lattice parameters for the specimens annealed for 3000 h.  The lattice parameter of the f.c.c. matrix was estimated to be a = 0.3602 nm and that for the γ’-L12 phase a = 0.3595 nm.  The lattice parameter of the B2-NiAl was a = 0.2892 nm and those for the C14 Fe2Nb Laves phase, a = 0.4823 nm and c = 0.7865 nm.  DAFA29 is a stainless steel that has a similar nominal composition to the DAFA26 sample with an addition of 0.1 wt. % C and 0.01 wt. % B.  The lattice parameter estimates for the γ’, f.c.c. matrix, and B2-NiAl are similar to the synchrotron XRD measured values for DAFA29 after being aged for 240 hours (γ’, a = 0.3599 nm, f.c.c., a = 0.3609 nm, B2-NiAl a = 0.2892 nm) [113].   The as-processed DAFA26 samples had a grain size of 20 µm and showed a small amount of grain growth to 28 µm after aging for 3000 h.

Hardness measurements of DAFA26 were taken after being aged at 750°C for 0, 1, 2, 8, 24, 72, 168, 720 and 3000 hours. Figure 6.2 shows the Vickers hardness of the alloy when aged up to 3000 hours.  The as-processed alloy showed a hardness of 294 ± 20 HV.  As DAFA26 is aged, its hardness continuously increases, reaching a peak hardness of 486 ± 39 HV after 24 hours of aging.  The hardness of the alloy then continues to decrease, reaching 387 ± 11 HV.

 	The microstructure of DAFA26 after aging is shown in Figure 6.3.  A number of microstructural changes can be observed.  The DAFA sample as-processed (Figure 6.3a) has Laves phase precipitates that appear to beare aligned along the hot rolling direction.  The Laves phase precipitates in the DAFA26 microstructure look similar to the Laves phase precipitation in a Fe-25%Al-3%Nb alloy that was forged at 1150°C [114].  The lower homogenization temperature appears to lead to an increased size of the Laves phase on the grain boundaries.  Yamamoto et. al also noted that compared to AFA samples homogenized at or above 1200°C the DAFA26 sample homogenized at 1100°C had very coarse Laves phase precipitates on the grain boundaries [21].  After aging for 2 h (Figure 6.3b) the sample has additional grain boundary coverage of alternating Laves and NiAl particles.  This alternating grain boundary pattern was present in small amounts in the as-processed condition, and is often more easily observed in micrographs of AFAs that have been exposed to prolonged aging at high temperature.  The grain boundary coverage increases as the sample is aged up to 3000 h (Figure 6.3c-e).

Figure 6.4 shows the grain boundaries and matrix of the DAFA26 at higher magnification as it is aged.  Figure 6.4a-c are SEM-BSE images and Figure 6.4d is a SEM-SE image.  In Figure 6.4a showing the as-processed DAFA26, there is very little grain boundary precipitation apart from large Laves phase precipitates.  As the sample is aged up to 720 h (Figure 6.4c) more grain boundary precipitation is evident and the alternating NiAl and Laves phase precipitates are visible.  This alternating precipitation is  similar to what has been seen in previous studies observing  the study of the evolution of precipitation of grain boundary precipitation in AFA-type alloys.   It is most likely that the grain boundary is able to include both coarse Laves phase particles and the alternating NiAl and Laves phase particles because DAFA26’s 1100°C homogenization temperature was not high enough to suppress the growth of coarse Laves phase precipitates on the grain boundary.  For example, Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) which was homogenized at 1250°C [75, 87, 115] and AFA alloy “41Z” studied by Yamamoto et. al, which was homogenized at 1200°C had no coarse Laves phase on the grain boundaries.    TheIn Figure 6.4d the SEM-SE image more clearly shows topographic contrast and the presence of the L12 precipitates. There are not only alternating Laves-NiAl particles on the grain boundaries, but tThere are also B2-NiAl particles that appear to have grown from the larger Laves phase particles that were initiallyhad been present in the matrix before aging.
the ~2 µm Laves particles that were present within grains in the as-processed condition show NiAl particle growth (Figure 0.3e and Figure 6.4d).  In addition to notable changes in the grain boundary precipitation, Figure 6.4c and d SEM images shows the presence of the the spherical L12 particles whose (110) peak was only strong enough to be observed in the in XRD pattern after the sample had been aged for 3000 h results (Figure 0.1).  The particles are visible in the SEM images after aging for 720 h (Figure 6.4c) and have grown noticeably in size after aging at 3000 h (Figure 6.4d).  There are also B2-NiAl particles that appear to have grown from the larger Laves phase particles that were initially present in the matrix before aging.

Figure 0.4: SEM images of DAFA26 samples grain boundaries: (a) as-processed, and aged at 750°C for  (b) 2 h; (c) 720 h;  and (d) 3000 h. 

The size of the Laves phase particles that are present in the as-processed state and up to 3000 h is stable at ~ 2µm. The volume fraction of these particles is relatively stable as well and is ~5-6% up to 720 h and peaked at ~8% after 3000 h.  Growth of additional Laves phase on the grain boundary had a modest impact on the overall volume fraction of the Laves phase (i.e. at 3000 h volume fraction was calculated at 7.60% only including Laves phase particles that were present beginning in the as-processed state and just 8.47% when the additional growth of the Laves phase grain boundary precipitates is included).  

TEM analysis shows the morphology and size of the L12 γ’-Ni3Al precipitates present in DAFA26 samples that have been aged.   In a TEM bright- field image of the sample after 72 h of aging, the L12 γ’-Ni3Al precipitates are shown to be spherical (Figure 6.5).  Figure 6.5b shows a selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern taken from the matrix [001] zone axis.  Two sets of diffraction spots are visible in the diffraction pattern.  The brighter spots belong to the f.c.c. matrix phase, and the weaker diffraction spots represent the L12 γ’-Ni3Al superlattice reflections.  The γ/γ’ microstructure observed in DAFA26 is common in Ni-based superalloys [45].  Analogous to the analysis of the similarly composed DAFA29 stainless steel [113] and other alloys that have been strengthened by L12 γ’-Ni3(Al,Ti) precipitates [21] the orientation relationship between the L12 phase and the f.c.c. matrix in DAFA26 is cube-on-cube (i.e. (￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p).

￼

As the sample is further aged for 720 h and 3000 h the L12-γ’ precipitates further increase in size (Figure 6.6).  TEM-EDS results show the composition of Laves and NiAl particles that have formed on grain boundaries (Figure 6.7). The Laves phase grain boundary particles show high Fe (45.6 at. %), Cr (10.5 at. %), Ni (14.8 at. %) and Nb content (18.1 at. %) and the NiAl particles have high Ni (46.1 at. %), Fe (9.7 at. %) and Al (38.9 at. %) content.  The composition trends are similar to what was reported for Al and Nb-rich precipitates in a Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) sample that had been solutionized, cold-worked to 50% and aged at 240 h at 800°C.  For example, in the NiAl particle, while the Fe content is smaller (9.7 versus 25.1 at. %), the approximately 1:1 atomic ratio of Ni to Fe and Al is maintained [75].

	Figure 6.8 shows a bright- field TEM image of the L12 particles after aging for 3000 h at 750°C.  Even after aging at 3000 h the γ’-precipitates remain spherical.   The L12 precipitates are nearly twice as large as compared to the sample aged for 720 h at 750°C (Figure 0.6).

In addition to TEM analysis, DAFA26 samples were observed using APT.  

Figure 6.9 shows a three-dimensional reconstruction of the as-hot-rolled DAFA26 alloy.  Only Al (green) and Ni (mauve) atoms are displayed in the γ’ precipitates, enabling the 3D identification of the Ni3Al precipitates.  L12 particles were observed in the as-processed DAFA26 samples.  γ' precipitates were uniformly and randomly distributed throughout the DAFA26 matrix.  The γ/γ’ microstructure observed in DAFA26 is common in Ni-based superalloys [45].

Figure 6.10 shows a proximity histogram across the γ-f.c.c. and γ’-L12 phases, revealing elemental partitioning between the phases.  Ni (66 at. %), Al (14 at. %), and Ti (10 at. %) are the major elements present in the γ’-L12 phase.  Ti additions are thought to stabilize the L12 phase, however the addition of Ti tends to lower the oxidation resistance of AFAs [21].  Much like in thea Fe-25%Al-3%Nb alloy [114], only ~1% Nb was detected in the matrix.

After DAFA26 is aged at 750°C for 2 hours (Figure 6.11) the γ’ particles show considerable growth as compared to the as-processed state (Figure 0.9).  The proximity histogram (Figure 6.12) reveals that the Ni content of the γ’ phase has increased from 66 at. % in the as-aged condition to 71 at. % after 2 hours of aging while, Al (14 at. %) showed little change from the as-processed condition, and the Ti content has decreased from 10 at. % in the as-processed condition to 8 at. % after aging for 2 hours.

After aging up to 72 and 720 h it appears that the particle composition is relatively stable with a slight decrease noted in Fe (7.9 at. % to 9.3 at. %) and Ni (69.4 at.% to 66.7 at. %) (Figure 6.13).

The evolution of the size of the L12 particles is shown in Figure 6.14.  The average particle diameter is plotted against the cube-root of time, with error bars indicating the standard deviation.  The particle sizes were approximated from LEAP data and TEM micrographs. In the as-processed state the L12 particles are ~ 4 nm in diameter and they increase to ~9 nm after being aged at 750°C for 2 h.  The particle size nearly doubles again as the sample is aged up to 72 h (19 nm).  After aging at 720 and 3000 h the particles increase from 52 to 90 nm, respectively.  The average length scale of particles initially changes rapidly and then slows down.  A linear relationship between the particle size and the cube-root of time was determined which satisfies the predictions of the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory for volume diffusion-controlled growth processes [116, 117].  Creep testing this alloy at 750°C appears to have little impact on the size evolution of L12 precipitates. The L12 precipitate size values are similar to what has been reported for this alloy after 952 h creep testing (71 nm) and in a similar alloythe DAFA29 alloy (DAFA26 with additions of C and B) after 3,008 h of testing (95 nm) [21].

￼
Figure 0.14.: Plot of the average L12 particle size versus the cube-root of the aging time for DAFA26 aged at 750°C.

In addition to L12 particle composition, trends in the evolution of the matrix composition were also revealed using APT results.  For example, based on APT data, as the sample is aged up to 720 h the amount of Fe in the matrix increases from ~42 at. % to ~56 at. %, while decreases are observed for Ni (~33 to 20 at. %,), Al (~7 to 3 at. %), and Ti (~3 to 0.4 at. %).  The decrease in Ni, Al, and Ti can be explained by the growth of the L12 precipitates as well as the growth of NiAl particles on the grain boundaries.  Keeping in mind that the analyzed amount of Cr in the as-processed DAFA26 is 14.8 at. %, the increase in Cr to 19 at. % after 720 h would be expected because Cr is a minor component of all the precipitate phases found in the matrix.


Based on the analysis of the precipitate and matrix evolution, it is unlikely that the presence of the Laves phase has much impact on room-temperature strength of DAFA26.  The increase in hardness that is observed up to 24 h (~ 484 HV) and the subsequent decrease to ~387 HV after aging at 3000 h is a result of phase coarsening.  Since the relative size and volume fraction of the Laves phase precipitates is stable, the presence of L12 Ni3(Al, Ti) precipitates influenced the hardness.  At peak hardness, the size of the L12 particles is between 9-19 nm.

7.4 Summary
1.	The microstructure of DAFA26 consists of C14 Fe2Nb Laves phase particles, B2-NiAl particles, and L12 Ni3(Al,Ti) particles.
2.	Laves phase particles are present both in the matrix and on the grain boundaries in the as-processed state up to 3000 h aging.  These particles were initially only along the rolling direction and throughout the aging the average particle size of these particles was stable at ~2 µm.  As the sample is aged, nucleation and growth of additional Laves phase particles occurs on the grain boundaries. These alternate with NiAl particles along the grain boundaries.  In addition, there is growth of NiAl on the Laves particles that were initially present in the as-processed case.
3.	APT and TEM analysis provided compositional data which shows the matrix being depleted of Ni, Al, and Ti due to the growth of Ni3Al.  Despite long-term aging up to 3000 h, the Ni3Al particles remain spherical.  The kinetics of Ni3Al precipitation shows good agreement with the LSW theory, with a particle diameter length scale showing t1/3 growth.  These precipitates have a cube-on-cube orientation relationship with the matrix (i.e. (￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p).
4.	Since the Laves phase particles are stable and only the L12 precipitates show changes in size along with aging, the hardness data suggests that it is the L12 precipitates and not the Laves phase particles that have the most impact on room temperature strength as the sample is aged.  
















Chapter 7  Conclusions and suggestions for future work

8.1 Conclusions
8.1.1 Microstructural changes due to cold work of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al 
1.	Upon aging Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) at 700 and 800°C, C14-Laves phase and B2-NiAl particles precipitate in an austenitic matrix.  With 90% cold-work and aging at 700°C the sample also forms L12 particles.
2.	Cold rolling prior to aging results in the creation of a heterogeneous defect structure within the matrix and facilitates the heterogeneous nucleation of both C14 Fe2Nb and B2-NiAl precipitates.
3.	At 700°C, cold work is effective in increasing precipitate volume fraction at each aging condition when compared to samples that are simply aged.
4.	The change in the kinetics occurring at the higher temperature of 800°C influences the effects of aging and cold work. Compared to material that had not been strained, defects introduced by cold work not only cause more rapid precipitation in the matrix but also increases the total volume fraction of precipitates as compared to material that had been simply aged.

8.1.2 Mechanical behavior of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %)
1.	Precipitation in Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb has an important effect on the material’s mechanical properties; an increase in precipitate growth was accompanied by an increase in strength.  Upon aging at 800°C, the Laves phase rapidly precipitates on the grain boundaries and these precipitates are coarser than those found within the matrix.  The Laves phase particle size is relatively stable as the sample is aged and they are initially larger than NiAl precipitates. The NiAl particles initially show slow growth but eventually that growth increases and the NiAl particles overtake the Laves phase particle size and become more than double their size. 
2.	Unlike within the matrix, on the grain boundary after aging for 1335 h, there is a much smaller size difference between the Laves phase and NiAl particles show a much smaller difference in size.  Despite nearly complete coverage of  the grain boundary by the two brittle phases the alloy still shows room-temperature ductility. 
3.	The alloy showed a fairly large increase in room-temperature yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) that was tied to the precipitation and growth of particles in the matrix. The strain-hardening exponent of the alloy was determined and generally showed a good fit to the Holloman equation. 

8.1.3  Analysis of orientation relationships between matrix and Laves and NiAl particles
1.	The orientation between the f.c.c. matrix and Laves phase was determined to have the ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p orientation relationship proposed by Denham and Silcock.  
2.	The B2-NiAl precipitates were determined to have a Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship with the matrix, i.e. ￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p. 
3.	Despite the presence of Laves phase and B2 NiAl precipitates in AFAs and other austenitic stainless steels, the orientation relationship between the Laves phase and the matrix is such that there is only a moderate misfit between the two, which helps to explain why these alloys can still remain ductile despite the presence of brittle phases.

8.1.4  Effect of Aging on the Microstructural Evolution of L12 γ’-precipitates
1.	AFA DAFA26 aged at 750°C was observed hasto have B2-NiAl, C14-Fe2Nb, and L12-Ni3(Al,Ti) particles in an f.c.c. matrix.
2.	Annealing the sample increases the amount of grain boundary precipitation present.  While at first, the grain boundaries solely consisted of large Fe2Nb particles, with aging a pattern of alternating Fe2Nb and NiAl particles appeared which is typical of the grain boundary evolution in a number of AFAs.  In addition, there is growth of NiAl particles on the Laves phase particles present in the matrix.
3.	The presence of Laves phase particles does not influence the room temperature hardness of DAFA26.  Instead, the hardness is influenced by the L12 precipitates.  These L12 precipitates have a cube-on-cube (￼m // ￼p, ￼m // ￼p) orientation relationship with the matrix.

8.2 Suggestions for future work
8.2.1 Effect of Si
The addition of silicon to steels has been shown to promote the formation of Laves phase in a number of alloys.  The effect of the addition of 0.2 at. % Si to Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) should be determined.  The following work should be performed: 
1.	Microstructural characterization of Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) and Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al-0.2Si (at. %) after solutionizing at 1250°C and aging at different times and temperatures.
2.	Hardness and tensile tests should be performed on both alloys at room temperature as well as at high temperature at different strain rates to determine and compare mechanical properties.
3.	Post-mortem and in-situ TEM should be used to investigate the effect of Si on the mechanical properties of both alloys.

8.2.2 Comparative analysis of Fe2Nb and NiAl precipitation amongst different AFAs
Investigation of Fe-14Cr-25Ni-2.5Nb-0.1Si-3.6Al (wt. %) compared to Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al (at. %) should be performed in order to better understand the precipitation of the B2-NiAl and Laves phases.  The following work should be performed:   
1.	The microstructural evolution of Fe-14Cr-25Ni-2.5Nb-0.1Si-3.6Al (wt. %) with aging at different temperatures should be studied.
2.	High temperature heating of both materials should be done in the TEM.  Now that precipitate-matrix orientation relationships have been determined for B2 and Laves phase precipitates, optimal conditions in the TEM might be obtained to provide experimental observations that will better elucidate the precipitation processes in these alloys. 
3.	Room-temperature straining tests should be performed in the SEM for both alloys to better understand the role of the grain boundary and how it affects room-temperature ductility.
